Global Cancer Statistics 2020: GLOBOCAN Estimates of Incidence and Mortality Worldwide for 36 Cancers in 185 Countries,"Abstract This article provides an update on the global cancer burden using the GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2‐fold to 3‐fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied &lt;2‐fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.",2021-02-04,2021,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21660,107581,3,1.0,"['Hyuna Sung', 'Jacques Ferlay', 'Rebecca L.

The PRISMA 2020 statement: an updated guideline for reporting systematic reviews,"The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, published in 2009, was designed to help systematic reviewers transparently report why the review was done, what the authors did, and what they found. Over the past decade, advances in systematic review methodology and terminology have necessitated an update to the guideline. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement and includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise, and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation.

MizAR 60 for Mizar 50,"As a present to Mizar on its 50th anniversary, we develop an AI/TP system that automatically proves about 60% of the Mizar theorems in the hammer setting. We also automatically prove 75% of the Mizar theorems when the automated provers are helped by using only the premises used in the human-written Mizar proofs. We describe the methods and large-scale experiments leading to these results. This includes in particular the E and Vampire provers, their ENIGMA and Deepire learning modifications, a number of learning-based premise selection methods, and the incremental loop that interleaves growing a corpus of millions of ATP proofs with training increasingly strong AI/TP systems on them.

,"Designing complex, dynamic yet multi-functional materials and devices is challenging because the design spaces for these materials have numerous interdependent and often conflicting constraints. Taking inspiration from advances in artificial intelligence and their applications in material discovery, we propose a computational method for designing metamorphic DNA-co-polymerized hydrogel structures. The method consists of a coarse-grained simulation and a deep learning-guided optimization system for exploring the immense design space of these structures. Here, we develop a simple numeric simulation of DNA-co-polymerized hydrogel shape change and seek to find designs for structured hydrogels that can fold into the shapes of different Arabic numerals in different actuation states. We train a convolutional neural network to classify and score the geometric outputs of the coarse-grained simulation to provide autonomous feedback for design optimization. We then construct a genetic algorithm that generates and selects large batches of material designs that compete with one another to evolve and converge on optimal objective-matching designs. We show that we are able to explore the large design space and learn important parameters and traits. We identify vital relationships between the material scale size and the range of shape change that can be achieved by individual domains and we elucidate trade-offs between different design parameters. Finally, we discover material designs capable of transforming into multiple different digits in different actuation states.",2022-01-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.4230/lipics.dna.28.4,49593,4,0.5044530481180057,"['Diederik P.

EMBI,"Requirements are an integral part of industry operation and projects. Not only do requirements dictate industrial operations, but they are used in legally binding contracts between supplier and purchaser. Some companies even have requirements as their core business. Most requirements are found in textual documents, this brings a couple of challenges such as ambiguity, scalability, maintenance, and finding relevant and related requirements. Having the requirements in a machine-readable format would be a solution to these challenges, however, existing requirements need to be transformed into machine-readable requirements using NLP technology. Using state-of-the-art NLP methods based on end-to-end neural modelling on such documents is not trivial because the language is technical and domain-specific and training data is not available. In this paper, we focus on one step in that direction, namely scope detection of textual requirements using weak supervision and a simple classifier based on BERT general domain word embeddings and show that using openly available data, it is possible to get promising results on domain-specific requirements documents.",2024-06-27,2024,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12561108,44944,0,0.7568936555163955,"['Jacob Devlin', 'Ming‐Wei Chang', 'Kenton Lee', 'Kristina Toutanova']",,True
Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold,"Abstract Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort 1–4 , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined 5 , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences 6,7 . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’ 8 —has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years 9 . Despite recent progress 10–14 , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) 15 , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.",2021-07-15,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2,39627,5,1.0,"['John Jumper', 'K Taki', 'Alexander Pritzel', 'Tim Green', 'Michael Figurnov', 'Olaf Ronneberger', 'Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool', 'Russ Bates', 'Augustin Žídek', 'Anna Potapenko', 'Alex Bridgland', 'Clemens Meyer', 'Simon Köhl', 'Andrew J.

Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows,"This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images,"April 8, 2009Groups at MIT and NYU have collected a dataset of millions of tiny colour images from the web. It is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this have found it di cult to learn a good set of lters from the images. We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is signi cantly",2024-01-01,2024,https://doi.org/10.57702/zp44cu3g,25434,0,0.5329027004372489,['Alex Krizhevsky'],,True
"Two new Later Stone Age sites from the Final Pleistocene in the Falémé Valley, eastern Senegal","Kenya one of the African countries has pledged to reduce neonatal death as per the 2030 World Health Organization target. Providing high-quality newborn care is critical in minimizing neonatal mortality. This study aimed to determine the factors that influence the quality of newborn care in Kenya. Secondary data from 11,863 participants of the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) were analyzed. The participants were chosen using two-stage stratified sampling. The quality of newborn care was operationalized as receiving all components of newborn care after childbirth, as reported by the mother. Using SPSS (version 29), univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to analyse the data. In this study, 32.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 31.0%-34.5%) of the mothers reported that their newborns had received all components of quality neonatal care after childbirth. Mothers who spent an average of one hour accessing the health facilities compared with those who spent less than half an hour were 1.33 (95%CI: 1.01–1.75) times more likely to report that their newborns had received quality newborn care. Mothers who gave birth in a non-government organization health facility were 30.37 (95%CI: 2.69–343.20) times more likely to report that their newborns had received quality newborn care compared with those who delivered from a faith-based organization. On the contrary, in terms of regions, mothers who lived in Nyanza, Eastern, and Rift Valley provinces compared with those who lived in the coastal regions were 0.53 (95%CI: 0.34–0.82), 0.61 (95%CI: 0.39–0.94), and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.41–0.93) times less likely to report that their newborns had received quality newborn care, respectively. Mothers who subscribed to other religions or faith (0.28 (95%CI: 0.10–0.76) compared with those from the Christian faith, were less likely to report that their newborns had received quality newborn care. Finally, mothers who gave birth through cesarean section were 0.44 (95%CI: 0.32–0.61) times less likely to report that their newborns had received quality newborn care than mothers who gave birth through spontaneous vaginal delivery. The study indicates that about a third of the neonates received quality newborn care and that facility-related and parental social factors were associated with receiving quality newborn care. Stakeholders need to pay more attention to newborn babies whose mothers come from certain regions of Kenya where the quality of newborn care was found to be low, minority religious faith denominations, and those who delivered by ceasearen section. Stakeholders also should focus on strengthening collaborations with NGO health facilities and achieving universal health coverage to improve the quality of newborn care provided in health facilities.",2024-03-28,2024,https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000667478,23691,-1,0.30714747103570617,"['Melissa Ochoa Frias', 'Charles‐Henri Malbert', 'Paul Meurice', 'David Val‐Laillet']",,True

MEGA11: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis Version 11,"Abstract The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software has matured to contain a large collection of methods and tools of computational molecular evolution. Here, we describe new additions that make MEGA a more comprehensive tool for building timetrees of species, pathogens, and gene families using rapid relaxed-clock methods. Methods for estimating divergence times and confidence intervals are implemented to use probability densities for calibration constraints for node-dating and sequence sampling dates for tip-dating analyses. They are supported by new options for tagging sequences with spatiotemporal sampling information, an expanded interactive Node Calibrations Editor, and an extended Tree Explorer to display timetrees. Also added is a Bayesian method for estimating neutral evolutionary probabilities of alleles in a species using multispecies sequence alignments and a machine learning method to test for the autocorrelation of evolutionary rates in phylogenies. The computer memory requirements for the maximum likelihood analysis are reduced significantly through reprogramming, and the graphical user interface has been made more responsive and interactive for very big data sets. These enhancements will improve the user experience, quality of results, and the pace of biological discovery.

"Cancer statistics, 2022","Abstract Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population‐based cancer occurrence and outcomes. Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2022, 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, including approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4% to 6% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9% to 8.2% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized‐stage increased suddenly by 4.5% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized‐stage diagnoses (from 17% in 2004 to 28% in 2018) and 3‐year relative survival (from 21% to 31%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer. In summary, progress has stagnated for breast and prostate cancers but strengthened for lung cancer, coinciding with changes in medical practice related to cancer screening and/or treatment. More targeted cancer control interventions and investment in improved early detection and treatment would facilitate reductions in cancer mortality.",2022-01-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21708,17631,3,0.40202464102939606,"['Rebecca L.

Global cancer statistics 2022: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries,"Abstract This article presents global cancer statistics by world region for the year 2022 based on updated estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). There were close to 20 million new cases of cancer in the year 2022 (including nonmelanoma skin cancers [NMSCs]) alongside 9.7 million deaths from cancer (including NMSC). The estimates suggest that approximately one in five men or women develop cancer in a lifetime, whereas around one in nine men and one in 12 women die from it. Lung cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 2022, responsible for almost 2.5 million new cases, or one in eight cancers worldwide (12.4% of all cancers globally), followed by cancers of the female breast (11.6%), colorectum (9.6%), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (4.9%). Lung cancer was also the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18.7%), followed by colorectal (9.3%), liver (7.8%), female breast (6.9%), and stomach (6.8%) cancers. Breast cancer and lung cancer were the most frequent cancers in women and men, respectively (both cases and deaths). Incidence rates (including NMSC) varied from four‐fold to five‐fold across world regions, from over 500 in Australia/New Zealand (507.9 per 100,000) to under 100 in Western Africa (97.1 per 100,000) among men, and from over 400 in Australia/New Zealand (410.5 per 100,000) to close to 100 in South‐Central Asia (103.3 per 100,000) among women. The authors examine the geographic variability across 20 world regions for the 10 leading cancer types, discussing recent trends, the underlying determinants, and the prospects for global cancer prevention and control. With demographics‐based predictions indicating that the number of new cases of cancer will reach 35 million by 2050, investments in prevention, including the targeting of key risk factors for cancer (including smoking, overweight and obesity, and infection), could avert millions of future cancer diagnoses and save many lives worldwide, bringing huge economic as well as societal dividends to countries over the forthcoming decades.",2024-04-04,2024,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21834,17361,3,1.0,"['Freddie Bray', 'Mathieu Laversanne', 'Hyuna Sung', 'Jacques Ferlay', 'Rebecca L.

Mortality data (through 2018) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2021, 1,898,160 new cancer cases and 608,570 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. After increasing for most of the 20th century, the cancer death rate has fallen continuously from its peak in 1991 through 2018, for a total decline of 31%, because of reductions in smoking and improvements in early detection and treatment. This translates to 3.2 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred if peak rates had persisted. Long‐term declines in mortality for the 4 leading cancers have halted for prostate cancer and slowed for breast and colorectal cancers, but accelerated for lung cancer, which accounted for almost one‐half of the total mortality decline from 2014 to 2018. The pace of the annual decline in lung cancer mortality doubled from 3.1% during 2009 through 2013 to 5.5% during 2014 through 2018 in men, from 1.8% to 4.4% in women, and from 2.4% to 5% overall. This trend coincides with steady declines in incidence (2.2%‐2.3%) but rapid gains in survival specifically for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For example, NSCLC 2‐year relative survival increased from 34% for persons diagnosed during 2009 through 2010 to 42% during 2015 through 2016, including absolute increases of 5% to 6% for every stage of diagnosis; survival for small cell lung cancer remained at 14% to 15%.

Detecting Functionality-Specific Vulnerabilities via Retrieving Individual Functionality-Equivalent APIs in Open-Source Repositories,"Functionality-specific vulnerabilities, which mainly occur in Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with specific functionalities, are crucial for software developers to detect and avoid. When detecting individual functionality-specific vulnerabilities, the existing two categories of approaches are ineffective because they consider only the API bodies and are unable to handle diverse implementations of functionality-equivalent APIs. To effectively detect functionality-specific vulnerabilities, we propose APISS, the first approach to utilize API doc strings and signatures instead of API bodies. APISS first retrieves functionality-equivalent APIs for APIs with existing vulnerabilities and then migrates Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) of the existing vulnerabilities for newly detected vulnerable APIs. To retrieve functionality-equivalent APIs, we leverage a Large Language Model for API embedding to improve the accuracy and address the effectiveness and scalability issues suffered by the existing approaches. To migrate PoCs of the existing vulnerabilities for newly detected vulnerable APIs, we design a semi-automatic schema to substantially reduce manual costs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation to empirically compare APISS with four state-of-the-art approaches of detecting vulnerabilities and two state-of-the-art approaches of retrieving functionality-equivalent APIs. The evaluation subjects include 180 widely used Java repositories using 10 existing vulnerabilities, along with their PoCs. The results show that APISS effectively retrieves functionality-equivalent APIs, achieving a Top-1 Accuracy of 0.81 while the best of the baselines under comparison achieves only 0.55. APISS is highly efficient: the manual costs are within 10 minutes per vulnerability and the end-to-end runtime overhead of testing one candidate API is less than 2 hours.

"Cancer statistics, 2023","Abstract Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population‐based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2023, 1,958,310 new cancer cases and 609,820 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer incidence increased for prostate cancer by 3% annually from 2014 through 2019 after two decades of decline, translating to an additional 99,000 new cases; otherwise, however, incidence trends were more favorable in men compared to women. For example, lung cancer in women decreased at one half the pace of men (1.1% vs. 2.6% annually) from 2015 through 2019, and breast and uterine corpus cancers continued to increase, as did liver cancer and melanoma, both of which stabilized in men aged 50 years and older and declined in younger men. However, a 65% drop in cervical cancer incidence during 2012 through 2019 among women in their early 20s, the first cohort to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine, foreshadows steep reductions in the burden of human papillomavirus‐associated cancers, the majority of which occur in women. Despite the pandemic, and in contrast with other leading causes of death, the cancer death rate continued to decline from 2019 to 2020 (by 1.5%), contributing to a 33% overall reduction since 1991 and an estimated 3.8 million deaths averted. This progress increasingly reflects advances in treatment, which are particularly evident in the rapid declines in mortality (approximately 2% annually during 2016 through 2020) for leukemia, melanoma, and kidney cancer, despite stable/increasing incidence, and accelerated declines for lung cancer. In summary, although cancer mortality rates continue to decline, future progress may be attenuated by rising incidence for breast, prostate, and uterine corpus cancers, which also happen to have the largest racial disparities in mortality.",2023-01-01,2023,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21763,15668,3,0.2638104927205617,"['Rebecca L.

Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift,"Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.",2024-01-01,2024,https://doi.org/10.57702/o9raffed,15635,0,0.5694386105103182,"['Sergey Ioffe', 'Christian Szegedy']",,True
A Multi-Modal Distributed Real-Time IoT System for Urban Traffic Control (Invited Paper),"Traffic congestion is one of the growing urban problem with associated problems like fuel wastage, loss of lives, and slow productivity. The existing traffic system uses programming logic control (PLC) with round-robin scheduling algorithm. Recent works have proposed IoT-based frameworks that use traffic density of each lane to control traffic movement, but they suffer from low accuracy due to lack of emergency vehicle image datasets for training deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed IoT framework that is based on two observations. The first observation is major structural changes to road are rare. This observation is exploited by proposing a novel two stage vehicle detector that is able to achieve 77% vehicle detection accuracy on UA-DETRAC dataset. The second observation is emergency vehicle have distinct siren sound that is detected using a novel acoustic detection algorithm on an edge device. The proposed system is able to detect emergency vehicles with an average accuracy of 99.4%.",2024-01-01,2024,https://doi.org/10.4230/oasics.ng-res.2024.2,14153,0,1.0,"['Joseph Redmon', 'Ali Farhadi']",,True

Evaluating the Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Representing Textual Descriptions of Geometry and Spatial Relations (Short Paper),"This research focuses on assessing the ability of large language models (LLMs) in representing geometries and their spatial relations. We utilize LLMs including GPT-2 and BERT to encode the well-known text (WKT) format of geometries and then feed their embeddings into classifiers and regressors to evaluate the effectiveness of the LLMs-generated embeddings for geometric attributes. The experiments demonstrate that while the LLMs-generated embeddings can preserve geometry types and capture some spatial relations (up to 73% accuracy), challenges remain in estimating numeric values and retrieving spatially related objects. This research highlights the need for improvement in terms of capturing the nuances and complexities of the underlying geospatial data and integrating domain knowledge to support various GeoAI applications using foundation models.",2023-01-01,2023,https://doi.org/10.4230/lipics.giscience.2023.43,14006,0,1.0,"['T.

On a Method to Measure Supervised Multiclass Model’s Interpretability: Application to Degradation Diagnosis (Short Paper),"In an industrial maintenance context, degradation diagnosis is the problem of determining the current level of degradation of operating machines based on measurements. With the emergence of Machine Learning techniques, such a problem can now be solved by training a degradation model offline and by using it online. While such models are more and more accurate and performant, they are often black-box and their decisions are therefore not interpretable for human maintenance operators. On the contrary, interpretable ML models are able to provide explanations for the model’s decisions and consequently improves the confidence of the human operator about the maintenance decision based on these models. This paper proposes a new method to quantitatively measure the interpretability of such models that is agnostic (no assumption about the class of models) and that is applied on degradation models. The proposed method requires that the decision maker sets up some high level parameters in order to measure the interpretability of the models and then can decide whether the obtained models are satisfactory or not. The method is formally defined and is fully illustrated on a decision tree degradation model and a model trained with a recent neural network architecture called Multiclass Neural Additive Model.",2024-01-01,2024,https://doi.org/10.4230/oasics.dx.2024.27,12892,0,1.0,"['Scott Lundberg', 'Su‐In Lee']",,True

Quantifying the Sim-To-Real Gap in UAV Disturbance Rejection,"Due to the safety risks and training sample inefficiency, it is often preferred to develop controllers in simulation. However, minor differences between the simulation and the real world can cause a significant sim-to-real gap. This gap can reduce the effectiveness of the developed controller. In this paper, we examine a case study of transferring an octorotor reinforcement learning controller from simulation to the real world. First, we quantify the effectiveness of the real-world transfer by examining safety metrics. We find that although there is a noticeable (around 100%) increase in deviation in real flights, this deviation may not be considered unsafe, as it will be within > 2m safety corridors. Then, we estimate the densities of the measurement distributions and compare the Jensen-Shannon divergences of simulated and real measurements. From this, we show that the vehicle’s orientation is significantly different between simulated and real flights. We attribute this to a different flight mode in real flights where the vehicle turns to face the next waypoint. We also find that the reinforcement learning controller actions appear to correctly counteract disturbance forces. Then, we analyze the errors of a measurement autoencoder and state transition model neural network applied to real data. We find that these models further reinforce the difference between the simulated and real attitude control, showing the errors directly on the flight paths. Finally, we discuss important lessons learned in the sim-to-real transfer of our controller.",2024-01-01,2024,https://doi.org/10.4230/oasics.dx.2024.16,11172,0,0.3672581605919597,"['John Schulman', 'Filip Wolski', 'Prafulla Dhariwal', 'Alec Radford', 'Oleg Klimov']",,True

High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models,"By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve new state of the art scores for image inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.",2022-06-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr52688.2022.01042,10716,0,1.0,"['Robin Rombach', 'Andreas Blattmann', 'Dominik Lorenz', 'Patrick Esser', 'Björn Ommer']",,False

The 2021 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System: a summary,"Abstract The fifth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS), published in 2021, is the sixth version of the international standard for the classification of brain and spinal cord tumors. Building on the 2016 updated fourth edition and the work of the Consortium to Inform Molecular and Practical Approaches to CNS Tumor Taxonomy, the 2021 fifth edition introduces major changes that advance the role of molecular diagnostics in CNS tumor classification. At the same time, it remains wedded to other established approaches to tumor diagnosis such as histology and immunohistochemistry. In doing so, the fifth edition establishes some different approaches to both CNS tumor nomenclature and grading and it emphasizes the importance of integrated diagnoses and layered reports. New tumor types and subtypes are introduced, some based on novel diagnostic technologies such as DNA methylome profiling. The present review summarizes the major general changes in the 2021 fifth edition classification and the specific changes in each taxonomic category. It is hoped that this summary provides an overview to facilitate more in-depth exploration of the entire fifth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System.",2021-05-03,2021,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/noab106,10245,-1,0.36545839317745105,"['David N.

Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized tools: far greater accuracy for protein–ligand interactions compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher accuracy for protein–nucleic acid interactions compared with nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher antibody–antigen prediction accuracy compared with AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.3 7,8 .

Hallmarks of Cancer: New Dimensions,"Abstract The hallmarks of cancer conceptualization is a heuristic tool for distilling the vast complexity of cancer phenotypes and genotypes into a provisional set of underlying principles. As knowledge of cancer mechanisms has progressed, other facets of the disease have emerged as potential refinements. Herein, the prospect is raised that phenotypic plasticity and disrupted differentiation is a discrete hallmark capability, and that nonmutational epigenetic reprogramming and polymorphic microbiomes both constitute distinctive enabling characteristics that facilitate the acquisition of hallmark capabilities. Additionally, senescent cells, of varying origins, may be added to the roster of functionally important cell types in the tumor microenvironment. Significance: Cancer is daunting in the breadth and scope of its diversity, spanning genetics, cell and tissue biology, pathology, and response to therapy. Ever more powerful experimental and computational tools and technologies are providing an avalanche of “big data” about the myriad manifestations of the diseases that cancer encompasses. The integrative concept embodied in the hallmarks of cancer is helping to distill this complexity into an increasingly logical science, and the provisional new dimensions presented in this perspective may add value to that endeavor, to more fully understand mechanisms of cancer development and malignant progression, and apply that knowledge to cancer medicine.",2022-01-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.cd-21-1059,7899,3,0.41152493941802326,['Douglas Hanahan'],,True
"Cancer statistics, 2024","Abstract Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population‐based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries (through 2020) and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (through 2021). In 2024, 2,001,140 new cancer cases and 611,720 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer mortality continued to decline through 2021, averting over 4 million deaths since 1991 because of reductions in smoking, earlier detection for some cancers, and improved treatment options in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. However, these gains are threatened by increasing incidence for 6 of the top 10 cancers. Incidence rates increased during 2015–2019 by 0.6%–1% annually for breast, pancreas, and uterine corpus cancers and by 2%–3% annually for prostate, liver (female), kidney, and human papillomavirus‐associated oral cancers and for melanoma. Incidence rates also increased by 1%–2% annually for cervical (ages 30–44 years) and colorectal cancers (ages &lt;55 years) in young adults. Colorectal cancer was the fourth‐leading cause of cancer death in both men and women younger than 50 years in the late‐1990s but is now first in men and second in women. Progress is also hampered by wide persistent cancer disparities; compared to White people, mortality rates are two‐fold higher for prostate, stomach and uterine corpus cancers in Black people and for liver, stomach, and kidney cancers in Native American people. Continued national progress will require increased investment in cancer prevention and access to equitable treatment, especially among American Indian and Alaska Native and Black individuals.",2024-01-01,2024,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21820,7708,3,0.31657592794532485,"['Rebecca L.

The STRING database in 2023: protein–protein association networks and functional enrichment analyses for any sequenced genome of interest,"Abstract Much of the complexity within cells arises from functional and regulatory interactions among proteins. The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein–protein interactions—both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface. Furthermore, STRING continues to enhance its facilities for functional enrichment analysis, which are now fully available also for user-submitted genomes.",2022-11-12,2022,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac1000,6650,5,0.3804646422088056,"['Damian Szklarczyk', 'Rebecca Kirsch', 'Mikaela Koutrouli', 'Katerina Nastou', 'Farrokh Mehryary', 'Radja Hachilif', 'Annika L Gable', 'Tao Fang', 'Nadezhda T.

Attention Is All You Need,"The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",2025-08-23,2025,https://doi.org/10.65215/ne77pf66,6466,-1,0.30608551051417066,"['Ashish Vaswani', 'Noam Shazeer', 'Niki Parmar', 'Jakob Uszkoreit', 'Llion Jones', 'Aidan N.

The PRIDE database resources in 2022: a hub for mass spectrometry-based proteomics evidences,"Abstract The PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) is the world's largest data repository of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. PRIDE is one of the founding members of the global ProteomeXchange (PX) consortium and an ELIXIR core data resource. In this manuscript, we summarize the developments in PRIDE resources and related tools since the previous update manuscript was published in Nucleic Acids Research in 2019. The number of submitted datasets to PRIDE Archive (the archival component of PRIDE) has reached on average around 500 datasets per month during 2021. In addition to continuous improvements in PRIDE Archive data pipelines and infrastructure, the PRIDE Spectra Archive has been developed to provide direct access to the submitted mass spectra using Universal Spectrum Identifiers. As a key point, the file format MAGE-TAB for proteomics has been developed to enable the improvement of sample metadata annotation. Additionally, the resource PRIDE Peptidome provides access to aggregated peptide/protein evidences across PRIDE Archive. Furthermore, we will describe how PRIDE has increased its efforts to reuse and disseminate high-quality proteomics data into other added-value resources such as UniProt, Ensembl and Expression Atlas.",2021-10-16,2021,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab1038,6330,5,0.49714954808796163,"['Yasset Pérez‐Riverol', 'Jingwen Bai', 'Chakradhar Bandla', 'David García‐Seisdedos', 'Suresh Hewapathirana', 'Selvakumar Kamatchinathan', 'Deepti J Kundu', 'Ananth Prakash', 'Anika Frericks-Zipper', 'Martin Eisenacher', 'Mathias Walzer', 'Shengbo Wang', 'Alvis Brāzma', 'Juan Antonio Vizcaíno']",,True

Review of Particle Physics,"Abstract The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 2,143 new measurements from 709 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Machine Learning, and one on Spectroscopy of Light Meson Resonances. The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 97 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 23 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings. The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book.

KEGG for taxonomy-based analysis of pathways and genomes,"Abstract KEGG (https://www.kegg.jp) is a manually curated database resource integrating various biological objects categorized into systems, genomic, chemical and health information. Each object (database entry) is identified by the KEGG identifier (kid), which generally takes the form of a prefix followed by a five-digit number, and can be retrieved by appending /entry/kid in the URL. The KEGG pathway map viewer, the Brite hierarchy viewer and the newly released KEGG genome browser can be launched by appending /pathway/kid, /brite/kid and /genome/kid, respectively, in the URL. Together with an improved annotation procedure for KO (KEGG Orthology) assignment, an increasing number of eukaryotic genomes have been included in KEGG for better representation of organisms in the taxonomic tree. Multiple taxonomy files are generated for classification of KEGG organisms and viruses, and the Brite hierarchy viewer is used for taxonomy mapping, a variant of Brite mapping in the new KEGG Mapper suite. The taxonomy mapping enables analysis of, for example, how functional links of genes in the pathway and physical links of genes on the chromosome are conserved among organism groups.",2022-10-13,2022,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac963,5892,5,1.0,"['Minoru Kanehisa', 'Miho Furumichi', 'Yoko Sato', 'Masayuki Kawashima', 'Mari Ishiguro-Watanabe']",,True

Science,"The asymmetric α-addition of relatively nonpolar hydrocarbon substrates, such as allyl and aryl groups, to aldehydes and ketones remains a largely unsolved problem in organic synthesis, despite the wide potential utility of direct routes to such products. We reasoned that well-established chiral amine catalysis, which activates aldehydes toward electrophile addition by enamine formation, could be expanded to this important reaction class by applying a single-electron oxidant to create a transient radical species from the enamine. We demonstrated the concept of singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) activation with a highly selective α-allylation of aldehydes, and we here present preliminary results for enantioselective heteroarylations and cyclization/halogenation cascades.",2023-07-12,2023,https://doi.org/10.1126/science,5862,4,0.3757651412583396,['Marcus E.

A ConvNet for the 2020s,"The ""Roaring 20s"" of visual recognition began with the introduction of Vision Transformers (ViTs), which quickly superseded ConvNets as the state-of-the-art image classification model. A vanilla ViT, on the other hand, faces difficulties when applied to general computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve. We gradually ""modernize"" a standard ResNet toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure ConvNet models dubbed ConvNeXt. Constructed entirely from standard ConvNet modules, ConvNeXts compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving 87.8% ImageNet top-1 accuracy and outperforming Swin Transformers on COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation, while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of standard ConvNets.",2022-06-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr52688.2022.01167,5683,0,0.7637462396033924,"['Zhuang Liu', 'Hanzi Mao', 'Chao-Yuan Wu', 'Christoph Feichtenhofer', 'Trevor Darrell', 'Saining Xie']",,False

With its power to prohibit or compel, to take or give money, the state can and does selectively help or hurt a vast number of industries. Regulation may be actively sought by an industry, or it may be thrust upon it.

The DAVID Gene system was rebuilt to gain coverage of more organisms, which increased the taxonomy coverage from 17 399 to 55 464. All existing annotation types have been updated, if available, based on the new DAVID Gene system. Compared with the last version, the number of gene-term records for most annotation types within the updated Knowledgebase have significantly increased. Moreover, we have incorporated new annotations in the Knowledgebase including small molecule-gene interactions from PubChem, drug-gene interactions from DrugBank, tissue expression information from the Human Protein Atlas, disease information from DisGeNET, and pathways from WikiPathways and PathBank. Eight of ten subgroups split from Uniprot Keyword annotation were assigned to specific types. Finally, we added a species parameter for uploading a list of gene symbols to minimize the ambiguity between species, which increases the efficiency of the list upload and eliminates confusion for users. These current updates have significantly expanded the Knowledgebase and enhanced the discovery power of DAVID.",2022-03-11,2022,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac194,5363,5,0.3888425249697267,"['Brad T.

Methods: The American Heart Association, through its Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update. The 2021 Statistical Update is the product of a full year’s worth of effort by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff members. This year’s edition includes data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, an enhanced focus on social determinants of health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, vascular contributions to brain health, the global burden of cardiovascular disease, and further evidence-based approaches to changing behaviors related to cardiovascular disease. Results: Each of the 27 chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics. Conclusions: The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policy makers, media professionals, clinicians, health care administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions.",2021-01-27,2021,https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000950,5362,1,0.47743294490376864,"['Salim S.

Using Embeddings to Improve Named Entity Recognition Classification with Graphs,"Richer information has potential to improve performance of NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks such as Named Entity Recognition. A linear sequence of words can be enriched with the sentence structure, as well as their syntactic structure. However, traditional NLP methods do not contemplate this kind of information. With the use of Knowledge Graphs all this information can be represented and made use off by Graph ML (Machine Learning) techniques. Previous experiments using only graphs with their syntactic structure as input to current state-of-the-art Graph ML models failed to prove the potential of the technology. As such, in this paper the use of word embeddings is explored as an additional enrichment of the graph and, in consequence, of the input to the classification models. This use of embeddings adds a layer of context that was previously missing when using only syntactic information. The proposed method was assessed using CoNLL dataset and results showed noticeable improvements in performance when adding embeddings. The best accuracy results with embedings attained 94.73 % accuracy, compared to the 88.58 % without embedings while metrics such as Macro-F1, Precision and Recall achieved an improvement in performance of over 20%. We test these models with a different number of classes to assess whether the quality of them would degrade or not. Due to the use of inductive learning methods (such as Graph SAGE) these results provide us with models that can be used in real-world scenarios as there is no need to re-train the whole graph to predict on new data points as is the case with traditional Graph ML methods (for example, Graph Convolutional Networks).",2024-01-01,2024,https://doi.org/10.4230/oasics.slate.2024.1,5323,0,0.6143761408226754,"['William L.

Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision,"State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.

Cancer statistics for the year 2020: An overview,"Abstract Our study briefly reviews the data sources and methods used in compiling the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) GLOBOCAN cancer statistics for the year 2020 and summarises the main results. National estimates were calculated based on the best available data on cancer incidence from population‐based cancer registries (PBCR) and mortality from the World Health Organization mortality database. Cancer incidence and mortality rates for 2020 by sex and age groups were estimated for 38 cancer sites and 185 countries or territories worldwide. There were an estimated 19.3 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 19.0‐19.6 million) new cases of cancer (18.1 million excluding non‐melanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million (95% UI: 9.7‐10.2 million) deaths from cancer (9.9 million excluding non‐melanoma skin cancer) worldwide in 2020. The most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide were female breast cancer (2.26 million cases), lung (2.21) and prostate cancers (1.41); the most common causes of cancer death were lung (1.79 million deaths), liver (830000) and stomach cancers (769000).",2021-04-05,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.33588,5169,3,0.6417930826471804,"['Jacques Ferlay', 'Murielle Colombet', 'Isabelle Soerjomataram', 'Donald Maxwell Parkin', 'Marion Piñeros', 'Ariana Znaor', 'Freddie Bray']",,True

Deep learning methods took center stage at CASP14, with DeepMind’s Alphafold2 achieving remarkable accuracy. Baek et al . explored network architectures based on the DeepMind framework. They used a three-track network to process sequence, distance, and coordinate information simultaneously and achieved accuracies approaching those of DeepMind.

Coordinate Attention for Efficient Mobile Network Design,"Recent studies on mobile network design have demonstrated the remarkable effectiveness of channel attention (e.g., the Squeeze-and-Excitation attention) for lifting model performance, but they generally neglect the positional information, which is important for generating spatially selective attention maps. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism for mobile networks by embedding positional information into channel attention, which we call ""coordinate attention"". Unlike channel attention that transforms a feature tensor to a single feature vector via 2D global pooling, the coordinate attention factorizes channel attention into two 1D feature encoding processes that aggregate features along the two spatial directions, respectively. In this way, long-range dependencies can be captured along one spatial direction and meanwhile precise positional information can be preserved along the other spatial direction. The resulting feature maps are then encoded separately into a pair of direction-aware and position-sensitive attention maps that can be complementarily applied to the input feature map to augment the representations of the objects of interest. Our coordinate attention is simple and can be flexibly plugged into classic mobile networks, such as MobileNetV2, MobileNeXt, and EfficientNet with nearly no computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our coordinate attention is not only beneficial to ImageNet classification but more interestingly, behaves better in down-stream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.

Tractatus logico-philosophicus,"The Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus first appeared in 1921 and was the only philosophical work that Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) published during his lifetime. Written in short, carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme compression and brilliance, it immediately convinced many of its readers and captured the imagination of all. Its chief influence, at first, was on the Logical Positivists of the 1920s and 1930s, but many other philosophers were stimulated by its philosophy of language, finding attractive, even if ultimately unsatisfactory, its view that propositions were pictures of reality. Perhaps most of all, its own author, after his return to philosophy in the late 1920s, was fascinated by its vision of an inexpressible, crystalline world of logical relationships. C.K. Ogden's translation of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus has a unique provenance. As revealed in Letters of C.K. Ogden (1973) and in correspondence in The Times Literary Supplement, Wittgenstein, Ramsey and Moore all worked with Ogden on the translation, which had Wittgenstein's complete approval.

Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting,"Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which achieves O(L log L) in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.",2021-05-18,2021,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i12.17325,4749,-1,0.21429253070135118,"['Haoyi Zhou', 'Shanghang Zhang', 'Jieqi Peng', 'Shuai Zhang', 'Jianxin Li', 'Hui Xiong', 'Wancai Zhang']",,True

Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning,"Detecting and reading text from natural images is a hard computer vision task that is central to a variety of emerging applications. Related problems like document character recognition have been widely studied by computer vision and machine learning researchers and are virtually solved for practical applications like reading handwritten digits. Reliably recognizing characters in more complex scenes like photographs, however, is far more difficult: the best existing methods lag well behind human performance on the same tasks. In this paper we attack the problem of recognizing digits in a real application using unsupervised feature learning methods: reading house numbers from street level photos. To this end, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for research use containing over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from Street View images. We then demonstrate the difficulty of recognizing these digits when the problem is approached with hand-designed features. Finally, we employ variants of two recently proposed unsupervised feature learning methods and find that they are convincingly superior on our benchmarks. 1",2024-01-01,2024,https://doi.org/10.57702/e7wwo0zk,4548,0,0.57475106172744,"['Yuval Netzer', 'Tao Wang', 'Adam Coates', 'Alessandro Bissacco', 'Bo Wu', 'Andrew Y.

Our algorithm represents a scene using a fully connected (nonconvolutional) deep network, whose input is a single continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location ( x , y , z ) and viewing direction ( θ, ϕ )) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis.",2021-12-17,2021,https://doi.org/10.1145/3503250,4497,0,0.6194619928603226,"['Ben Mildenhall', 'Pratul P.

On Assessing ML Model Robustness: A Methodological Framework (Academic Track),"Due to their uncertainty and vulnerability to adversarial attacks, machine learning (ML) models can lead to severe consequences, including the loss of human life, when embedded in safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the empirical robustness of such models before integrating them into these systems. ML model robustness refers to the ability of an ML model to be insensitive to input perturbations and maintain its performance. Against this background, the Confiance.ai research program proposes a methodological framework for assessing the empirical robustness of ML models. The framework encompasses methodological processes (guidelines) captured in Capella models, along with a set of supporting tools.

Sample sizes for saturation in qualitative research: A systematic review of empirical tests,"To review empirical studies that assess saturation in qualitative research in order to identify sample sizes for saturation, strategies used to assess saturation, and guidance we can draw from these studies.We conducted a systematic review of four databases to identify studies empirically assessing sample sizes for saturation in qualitative research, supplemented by searching citing articles and reference lists.We identified 23 articles that used empirical data (n = 17) or statistical modeling (n = 6) to assess saturation. Studies using empirical data reached saturation within a narrow range of interviews (9-17) or focus group discussions (4-8), particularly those with relatively homogenous study populations and narrowly defined objectives. Most studies had a relatively homogenous study population and assessed code saturation; the few outliers (e.g., multi-country research, meta-themes, ""code meaning"" saturation) needed larger samples for saturation.Despite varied research topics and approaches to assessing saturation, studies converged on a relatively consistent sample size for saturation for commonly used qualitative research methods. However, these findings apply to certain types of studies (e.g., those with homogenous study populations). These results provide strong empirical guidance on effective sample sizes for qualitative research, which can be used in conjunction with the characteristics of individual studies to estimate an appropriate sample size prior to data collection. This synthesis also provides an important resource for researchers, academic journals, journal reviewers, ethical review boards, and funding agencies to facilitate greater transparency in justifying and reporting sample sizes in qualitative research.

In silico analysis enabling informed design for genome editing in medicinal cannabis; gene families and variant characterisation,"Cannabis has been used worldwide for centuries for industrial, recreational and medicinal use, however, to date no successful attempts at editing genes involved in cannabinoid biosynthesis have been reported. This study proposes and develops an in silico best practices approach for the design and implementation of genome editing technologies in cannabis to target all genes involved in cannabinoid biosynthesis. A large dataset of reference genomes was accessed and mined to determine copy number variation and associated SNP variants for optimum target edit sites for genotype independent editing. Copy number variance and highly polymorphic gene sequences exist in the genome making genome editing using CRISPR, Zinc Fingers and TALENs technically difficult. Evaluation of allele or additional gene copies was determined through nucleotide and amino acid alignments with comparative sequence analysis performed. From determined gene copy number and presence of SNPs, multiple online CRISPR design tools were used to design sgRNA targeting every gene, accompanying allele and homologs throughout all involved pathways to create knockouts for further investigation. Universal sgRNA were designed for highly homologous sequences using MultiTargeter and visualised using Sequencher, creating unique sgRNA avoiding SNP and shared nucleotide locations targeting optimal edit sites. Using this framework, the approach has wider applications to all plant species regardless of ploidy number or highly homologous gene sequences. Using this framework, a best-practice approach to genome editing is possible in all plant species, including cannabis, delivering a comprehensive in silico evaluation of the cannabinoid pathway diversity from a large set of whole genome sequences.

On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots,"The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English.

Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks?

Pyramid Vision Transformer: A Versatile Backbone for Dense Prediction without Convolutions,"Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in computer vision, this work investigates a simpler, convolution-free backbone network use-fid for many dense prediction tasks. Unlike the recently-proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) that was designed for image classification specifically, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT), which overcomes the difficulties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction tasks. PVT has several merits compared to current state of the arts. (1) Different from ViT that typically yields low-resolution outputs and incurs high computational and memory costs, PVT not only can be trained on dense partitions of an image to achieve high output resolution, which is important for dense prediction, but also uses a progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce the computations of large feature maps. (2) PVT inherits the advantages of both CNN and Transformer, making it a unified backbone for various vision tasks without convolutions, where it can be used as a direct replacement for CNN backbones. (3) We validate PVT through extensive experiments, showing that it boosts the performance of many downstream tasks, including object detection, instance and semantic segmentation. For example, with a comparable number of parameters, PVT+RetinaNet achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO dataset, surpassing ResNet50+RetinNet (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute AP (see Figure 2). We hope that PVT could, serre as an alternative and useful backbone for pixel-level predictions and facilitate future research.",2021-10-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/iccv48922.2021.00061,4221,0,1.0,"['Wenhai Wang', 'Enze Xie', 'Xiang Li', 'Deng-Ping Fan', 'Kaitao Song', 'Ding Liang', 'Tong Lü', 'Ping Luo', 'Ling Shao']",,False
Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers,"In this paper, we question if self-supervised learning provides new properties to Vision Transformer (ViT) that stand out compared to convolutional networks (convnets). Beyond the fact that adapting self-supervised methods to this architecture works particularly well, we make the following observations: first, self-supervised ViT features contain explicit information about the semantic segmentation of an image, which does not emerge as clearly with supervised ViTs, nor with convnets. Second, these features are also excellent k-NN classifiers, reaching 78.3% top-1 on ImageNet with a small ViT. Our study also underlines the importance of momentum encoder, multi-crop training, and the use of small patches with ViTs. We implement our findings into a simple self-supervised method, called DINO, which we interpret as a form of self-distillation with no labels.

Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback,"Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at following a user's intent. For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets.

African Journal of Agricultural Research,"Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum F. sp. phaseoli caused growers to abandon the most popular climbing bean cultivar, Umubano (G2333) in Rwanda. The present objective was to determine the nature of inheritance of fusarium wilt resistance and recommend a breeding strategy to introduce resistance into susceptible cultivars. Two cultivars, vuninkingi (G685) and flora were donors of resistance to fusarium wilt whereas G2333 was highly susceptible. Injured root tips of 10-day old seedlings of the\n parents, progenies of F1 and F2 (G2333 × G685) and (G2333 × Flora), backcrosses F2 (G685 × Flora) were inoculated with 106 conidia ml-1 of Rwandan isolate of F. oxysporum F. sp phaseoli (FOP-RW2) in a glasshouse. The disease severity was rated 28 days later using the CIAT scale of 1 - 9, where 1 - 3 represent resistant, 4 - 6 tolerant and 7 - 9 susceptible reactions. The chi-square analysis was performed to determine the Mendelian segregation ratios of resistant and susceptibility among the inoculated progenies. The F1 and the backcross progenies to the resistant parents segregated in the ratio of 1:0 as\n did the F2 population (G685 × Flora). The F2 progenies segregated in the ratio of 3:1. The backcross progenies to the susceptible parent segregated in the ratio of 1:1. Resistance to fusarium wilt is conditioned by a single highly heritable major dominant gene. The resistance can be achieved by backcross breeding.",2025-11-27,2025,https://doi.org/10.5897/ajar,4068,-1,0.24384082664904502,"['Augustine Musoni', 'Paul M. Kimani', 'R. D.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"Ammonia-oxidizing archaea are ubiquitous in marine and terrestrial environments and now thought to be significant contributors to carbon and nitrogen cycling. The isolation of Candidatus “Nitrosopumilus maritimus” strain SCM1 provided the opportunity for linking its chemolithotrophic physiology with a genomic inventory of the globally distributed archaea. Here we report the 1,645,259-bp closed genome of strain SCM1, revealing highly copper-dependent systems for ammonia oxidation and electron transport that are distinctly different from known ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Consistent with in situ isotopic studies of marine archaea, the genome sequence indicates N. maritimus grows autotrophically using a variant of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutryrate pathway for carbon assimilation, while maintaining limited capacity for assimilation of organic carbon. This unique instance of archaeal biosynthesis of the osmoprotectant ectoine and an unprecedented enrichment of multicopper oxidases, thioredoxin-like proteins, and transcriptional regulators points to an organism responsive to environmental cues and adapted to handling reactive copper and nitrogen species that likely derive from its distinctive biochemistry.

Copper induces cell death by targeting lipoylated TCA cycle proteins,"Copper is an essential cofactor for all organisms, and yet it becomes toxic if concentrations exceed a threshold maintained by evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanisms. How excess copper induces cell death, however, is unknown. Here, we show in human cells that copper-dependent, regulated cell death is distinct from known death mechanisms and is dependent on mitochondrial respiration. We show that copper-dependent death occurs by means of direct binding of copper to lipoylated components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This results in lipoylated protein aggregation and subsequent iron-sulfur cluster protein loss, which leads to proteotoxic stress and ultimately cell death. These findings may explain the need for ancient copper homeostatic mechanisms.",2022-03-17,2022,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abf0529,3964,3,1.0,"['Peter Tsvetkov', 'Shannon Coy', 'Boryana Petrova', 'Margaret Dreishpoon', 'Ana Verma', 'Mai Abdusamad', 'Jordan Rossen', 'Lena Joesch-Cohen', 'Ranad Humeidi', 'Ryan D.

"The coefficient of determination R-squared is more informative than SMAPE, MAE, MAPE, MSE and RMSE in regression analysis evaluation","Regression analysis makes up a large part of supervised machine learning, and consists of the prediction of a continuous independent target from a set of other predictor variables. The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error (MSE) and its rooted variant (RMSE), or the mean absolute error (MAE) and its percentage variant (MAPE). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as R -squared or R 2 ) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). After showing their mathematical properties, we report a comparison between R 2 and SMAPE in several use cases and in two real medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination ( R -squared) is more informative and truthful than SMAPE, and does not have the interpretability limitations of MSE, RMSE, MAE and MAPE. We therefore suggest the usage of R -squared as standard metric to evaluate regression analyses in any scientific domain.",2021-07-05,2021,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.623,3896,2,1.0,"['Davide Chicco', 'Matthijs J.

MetaboAnalyst 5.0: narrowing the gap between raw spectra and functional insights,"Abstract Since its first release over a decade ago, the MetaboAnalyst web-based platform has become widely used for comprehensive metabolomics data analysis and interpretation. Here we introduce MetaboAnalyst version 5.0, aiming to narrow the gap from raw data to functional insights for global metabolomics based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Three modules have been developed to help achieve this goal, including: (i) a LC–MS Spectra Processing module which offers an easy-to-use pipeline that can perform automated parameter optimization and resumable analysis to significantly lower the barriers to LC-MS1 spectra processing; (ii) a Functional Analysis module which expands the previous MS Peaks to Pathways module to allow users to intuitively select any peak groups of interest and evaluate their enrichment of potential functions as defined by metabolic pathways and metabolite sets; (iii) a Functional Meta-Analysis module to combine multiple global metabolomics datasets obtained under complementary conditions or from similar studies to arrive at comprehensive functional insights. There are many other new functions including weighted joint-pathway analysis, data-driven network analysis, batch effect correction, merging technical replicates, improved compound name matching, etc. The web interface, graphics and underlying codebase have also been refactored to improve performance and user experience. At the end of an analysis session, users can now easily switch to other compatible modules for a more streamlined data analysis.

Protein complex prediction with AlphaFold-Multimer,"While the vast majority of well-structured single protein chains can now be predicted to high accuracy due to the recent AlphaFold [1] model, the prediction of multi-chain protein complexes remains a challenge in many cases. In this work, we demonstrate that an AlphaFold model trained specifically for multimeric inputs of known stoichiometry, which we call AlphaFold-Multimer, significantly increases accuracy of predicted multimeric interfaces over input-adapted single-chain AlphaFold while maintaining high intra-chain accuracy. On a benchmark dataset of 17 heterodimer proteins without templates (introduced in [2]) we achieve at least medium accuracy (DockQ [3] ≥ 0.49) on 13 targets and high accuracy (DockQ ≥ 0.8) on 7 targets, compared to 9 targets of at least medium accuracy and 4 of high accuracy for the previous state of the art system (an AlphaFold-based system from [2]). We also predict structures for a large dataset of 4,446 recent protein complexes, from which we score all non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface (DockQ ≥ 0.23) in 70% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions (DockQ ≥ 0.8) in 26% of cases, an improvement of +27 and +14 percentage points over the flexible linker modification of AlphaFold [4] respectively.

TransUNet: Transformers Make Strong Encoders for Medical Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation is an essential prerequisite for developing healthcare systems, especially for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. On various medical image segmentation tasks, the u-shaped architecture, also known as U-Net, has become the de-facto standard and achieved tremendous success. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations, U-Net generally demonstrates limitations in explicitly modeling long-range dependency. Transformers, designed for sequence-to-sequence prediction, have emerged as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention mechanisms, but can result in limited localization abilities due to insufficient low-level details. In this paper, we propose TransUNet, which merits both Transformers and U-Net, as a strong alternative for medical image segmentation. On one hand, the Transformer encodes tokenized image patches from a convolution neural network (CNN) feature map as the input sequence for extracting global contexts. On the other hand, the decoder upsamples the encoded features which are then combined with the high-resolution CNN feature maps to enable precise localization. We argue that Transformers can serve as strong encoders for medical image segmentation tasks, with the combination of U-Net to enhance finer details by recovering localized spatial information. TransUNet achieves superior performances to various competing methods on different medical applications including multi-organ segmentation and cardiac segmentation.

ERA5-Land: a state-of-the-art global reanalysis dataset for land applications,"Abstract. Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management. The full ERA5-Land hourly (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019a) and monthly (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019b) averaged datasets presented in this paper are available through the C3S Climate Data Store at https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac and https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.68d2bb30, respectively.",2021-09-07,2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-4349-2021,3679,2,0.7129400795215957,"['Joaquín Muñoz‐Sabater', 'Emanuel Dutra', 'Anna Agustí‐Panareda', 'Clément Albergel', 'Gabriele Arduini', 'Gianpaolo Balsamo', 'Souhail Boussetta', 'Margarita Choulga', 'Shaun Harrigan', 'Hans Hersbach', 'Brecht Martens', 'Diego G.

"Cancer treatment and survivorship statistics, 2022","Abstract The number of cancer survivors continues to increase in the United States due to the growth and aging of the population as well as advances in early detection and treatment. To assist the public health community in better serving these individuals, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute collaborate triennially to estimate cancer prevalence in the United States using incidence and survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries, vital statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics, and population projections from the US Census Bureau. Current treatment patterns based on information in the National Cancer Database are presented for the most prevalent cancer types by race, and cancer‐related and treatment‐related side‐effects are also briefly described. More than 18 million Americans (8.3 million males and 9.7 million females) with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2022. The 3 most prevalent cancers are prostate (3,523,230), melanoma of the skin (760,640), and colon and rectum (726,450) among males and breast (4,055,770), uterine corpus (891,560), and thyroid (823,800) among females. More than one‐half (53%) of survivors were diagnosed within the past 10 years, and two‐thirds (67%) were aged 65 years or older. One of the largest racial disparities in treatment is for rectal cancer, for which 41% of Black patients with stage I disease receive proctectomy or proctocolectomy compared to 66% of White patients. Surgical receipt is also substantially lower among Black patients with non‐small cell lung cancer, 49% for stages I‐II and 16% for stage III versus 55% and 22% for White patients, respectively. These treatment disparities are exacerbated by the fact that Black patients continue to be less likely to be diagnosed with stage I disease than White patients for most cancers, with some of the largest disparities for female breast (53% vs 68%) and endometrial (59% vs 73%). Although there are a growing number of tools that can assist patients, caregivers, and clinicians in navigating the various phases of cancer survivorship, further evidence‐based strategies and equitable access to available resources are needed to mitigate disparities for communities of color and optimize care for people with a history of cancer.

SwinIR: Image Restoration Using Swin Transformer,"Image restoration is a long-standing low-level vision problem that aims to restore high-quality images from low-quality images (e.g., downscaled, noisy and compressed images). While state-of-the-art image restoration methods are based on convolutional neural networks, few attempts have been made with Transformers which show impressive performance on high-level vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline model SwinIR for image restoration based on the Swin Transformer. SwinIR consists of three parts: shallow feature extraction, deep feature extraction and high-quality image reconstruction. In particular, the deep feature extraction module is composed of several residual Swin Transformer blocks (RSTB), each of which has several Swin Transformer layers together with a residual connection. We conduct experiments on three representative tasks: image super-resolution (including classical, lightweight and real-world image super-resolution), image denoising (including grayscale and color image denoising) and JPEG compression artifact reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on different tasks by up to 0.14∼0.45dB, while the total number of parameters can be reduced by up to 67%.",2021-10-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/iccvw54120.2021.00210,3538,0,0.8248758678099846,"['Jingyun Liang', 'Jiezhang Cao', 'Guolei Sun', 'Kai Zhang', 'Luc Van Gool', 'Radu Timofte']",,False

"Colorectal cancer statistics, 2023","Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society provides an update of CRC statistics based on incidence from population‐based cancer registries and mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2023, approximately 153,020 individuals will be diagnosed with CRC and 52,550 will die from the disease, including 19,550 cases and 3750 deaths in individuals younger than 50 years. The decline in CRC incidence slowed from 3%–4% annually during the 2000s to 1% annually during 2011–2019, driven partly by an increase in individuals younger than 55 years of 1%–2% annually since the mid‐1990s. Consequently, the proportion of cases among those younger than 55 years increased from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019. Incidence since circa 2010 increased in those younger than 65 years for regional‐stage disease by about 2%–3% annually and for distant‐stage disease by 0.5%–3% annually, reversing the overall shift to earlier stage diagnosis that occurred during 1995 through 2005. For example, 60% of all new cases were advanced in 2019 versus 52% in the mid‐2000s and 57% in 1995, before widespread screening. There is also a shift to left‐sided tumors, with the proportion of rectal cancer increasing from 27% in 1995 to 31% in 2019. CRC mortality declined by 2% annually from 2011–2020 overall but increased by 0.5%–3% annually in individuals younger than 50 years and in Native Americans younger than 65 years. In summary, despite continued overall declines, CRC is rapidly shifting to diagnosis at a younger age, at a more advanced stage, and in the left colon/rectum. Progress against CRC could be accelerated by uncovering the etiology of rising incidence in generations born since 1950 and increasing access to high‐quality screening and treatment among all populations, especially Native Americans.",2023-03-01,2023,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21772,3497,3,0.23793080778830747,"['Rebecca L.

Formal Semantics for Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Representations of Operational Games,"This paper develops a formal semantic framework for Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) representations of operational games. Operational games, as generalizations of strategic and dynamic games, provide powerful tools for modeling complex multi-agent interactions, but their analysis using traditional methods is limited due to the high dimensionality of state and strategy spaces. Drawing upon the constructive logical systems approach and the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we establish rigorous mathematical foundations for embedding operational game dynamics within KAN architectures. The framework encompasses structural, operational, and denotational semantics, facilitating theoretical analysis of convergence properties, expressiveness, and computational complexity. We establish convergence theorems for KAN-based representations of equilibrium strategies and demonstrate how KANs' learnable edge functions provide unique advantages for modeling complex multi-agent systems governed by operational game dynamics. Theoretical results establish conditions for representation adequacy, computational tractability, and semantic preservation under aggregation operations. The proposed framework advances the integration of operational game theory with KAN methodologies, providing a foundation for empirical implementation and theoretical extension in domains with complex strategic interactions.",2025-04-13,2025,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15206559,3455,-1,0.1866475276049942,"['Keyulu Xu', 'Weihua Hu', 'Jure Leskovec', 'Stefanie Jegelka']",,True

"Cancer statistics in China and United States, 2022: profiles, trends, and determinants","Abstract Background: The cancer burden in the United States of America (USA) has decreased gradually. However, China is experiencing a transition in its cancer profiles, with greater incidence of cancers that were previously more common in the USA. This study compared the latest cancer profiles, trends, and determinants between China and USA. Methods: This was a comparative study using open-source data. Cancer cases and deaths in 2022 were calculated using cancer estimates from GLOBOCAN 2020 and population estimates from the United Nations. Trends in cancer incidence and mortality rates in the USA used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and National Center for Health Statistics. Chinese data were obtained from cancer registry reports. Data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 and a decomposition method were used to express cancer deaths as the product of four determinant factors. Results: In 2022, there will be approximately 4,820,000 and 2,370,000 new cancer cases, and 3,210,000 and 640,000 cancer deaths in China and the USA, respectively. The most common cancers are lung cancer in China and breast cancer in the USA, and lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both. Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates for lung cancer and colorectal cancer in the USA have decreased significantly recently, but rates of liver cancer have increased slightly. Rates of stomach, liver, and esophageal cancer decreased gradually in China, but rates have increased for colorectal cancer in the whole population, prostate cancer in men, and other seven cancer types in women. Increases in adult population size and population aging were major determinants for incremental cancer deaths, and case-fatality rates contributed to reduced cancer deaths in both countries. Conclusions: The decreasing cancer burden in liver, stomach, and esophagus, and increasing burden in lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate, mean that cancer profiles in China and the USA are converging. Population aging is a growing determinant of incremental cancer burden. Progress in cancer prevention and care in the USA, and measures to actively respond to population aging, may help China to reduce the cancer burden.",2022-02-09,2022,https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000002108,3311,3,0.5696448884758761,"['Changfa Xia', 'Xuesi Dong', 'He Li', 'Maomao Cao', 'Dianqin Sun', 'Siyi He', 'Fan Yang', 'Xinxin Yan', 'Shaoli Zhang', 'Ni Li', 'Wanqing Chen']",,True

Gene Set Knowledge Discovery with Enrichr,"Abstract Profiling samples from patients, tissues, and cells with genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics ultimately produces lists of genes and proteins that need to be further analyzed and integrated in the context of known biology. Enrichr (Chen et al., 2013; Kuleshov et al., 2016) is a gene set search engine that enables the querying of hundreds of thousands of annotated gene sets. Enrichr uniquely integrates knowledge from many high‐profile projects to provide synthesized information about mammalian genes and gene sets. The platform provides various methods to compute gene set enrichment, and the results are visualized in several interactive ways. This protocol provides a summary of the key features of Enrichr, which include using Enrichr programmatically and embedding an Enrichr button on any website. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Rethinking Semantic Segmentation from a Sequence-to-Sequence Perspective with Transformers,"Most recent semantic segmentation methods adopt a fully-convolutional network (FCN) with an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder progressively reduces the spatial resolution and learns more abstract/semantic visual concepts with larger receptive fields. Since context modeling is critical for segmentation, the latest efforts have been focused on increasing the receptive field, through either dilated/atrous convolutions or inserting attention modules. However, the encoder-decoder based FCN architecture remains unchanged. In this paper, we aim to provide an alternative perspective by treating semantic segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task. Specifically, we deploy a pure transformer (i.e., without convolution and resolution reduction) to encode an image as a sequence of patches. With the global context modeled in every layer of the transformer, this encoder can be combined with a simple decoder to provide a powerful segmentation model, termed SEgmentation TRansformer (SETR). Extensive experiments show that SETR achieves new state of the art on ADE20K (50.28% mIoU), Pascal Context (55.83% mIoU) and competitive results on Cityscapes. Particularly, we achieve the first position in the highly competitive ADE20K test server leaderboard on the day of submission.",2021-06-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr46437.2021.00681,3257,0,0.6310015797641887,"['Sixiao Zheng', 'Jiachen Lu', 'Hengshuang Zhao', 'Xiatian Zhu', 'Zekun Luo', 'Yabiao Wang', 'Yanwei Fu', 'Jianfeng Feng', 'Tao Xiang', 'Philip H.

"The Perception of the Environment: Essays on Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill","In this work Tim Ingold offers a persuasive new approach to understanding how human
beings perceive their surroundings. He argues that what we are used to calling cultural
variation consists, in the first place, of variations in skill. Neither innate nor acquired,
skills are grown, incorporated into the human organism through practice and training in
an environment. They are thus as much biological as cultural. To account for the generation of skills we have therefore to understand the dynamics of development. And this in
turn calls for an ecological approach that situates practitioners in the context of an active
engagement with the constituents of their surroundings.
The twenty-three essays comprising this book focus in turn on the procurement of livelihood, on what it means to ‘dwell’, and on the nature of skill, weaving together approaches
from social anthropology, ecological psychology, developmental biology and phenomenology in a way that has never been attempted before. The book is set to revolutionise
the way we think about what is ‘biological’ and ‘cultural’ in humans, about evolution and
history, and indeed about what it means for human beings – at once organisms and
persons – to inhabit an environment. The Perception of the Environment will be essential
reading not only for anthropologists but also for biologists, psychologists, archaeologists,
geographers and philosophers.",2021-11-30,2021,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003196662,3247,2,0.3341448579088998,['Tim Ingold'],,False

"ORB-SLAM3: An Accurate Open-Source Library for Visual, Visual–Inertial, and Multimap SLAM","This paper presents ORB-SLAM3, the first system able to perform visual,\nvisual-inertial and multi-map SLAM with monocular, stereo and RGB-D cameras,\nusing pin-hole and fisheye lens models. The first main novelty is a\nfeature-based tightly-integrated visual-inertial SLAM system that fully relies\non Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) estimation, even during the IMU initialization\nphase. The result is a system that operates robustly in real-time, in small and\nlarge, indoor and outdoor environments, and is 2 to 5 times more accurate than\nprevious approaches. The second main novelty is a multiple map system that\nrelies on a new place recognition method with improved recall. Thanks to it,\nORB-SLAM3 is able to survive to long periods of poor visual information: when\nit gets lost, it starts a new map that will be seamlessly merged with previous\nmaps when revisiting mapped areas. Compared with visual odometry systems that\nonly use information from the last few seconds, ORB-SLAM3 is the first system\nable to reuse in all the algorithm stages all previous information. This allows\nto include in bundle adjustment co-visible keyframes, that provide high\nparallax observations boosting accuracy, even if they are widely separated in\ntime or if they come from a previous mapping session. Our experiments show\nthat, in all sensor configurations, ORB-SLAM3 is as robust as the best systems\navailable in the literature, and significantly more accurate. Notably, our\nstereo-inertial SLAM achieves an average accuracy of 3.6 cm on the EuRoC drone\nand 9 mm under quick hand-held motions in the room of TUM-VI dataset, a setting\nrepresentative of AR/VR scenarios.

"Pre-train, Prompt, and Predict: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Methods in Natural Language Processing","This article surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural language processing, which we dub “prompt-based learning.” Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P ( y|x ), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x′ that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x̂ , from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: It allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this article, we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g., the choice of pre-trained language models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts but also release other resources, e.g., a website NLPedia–Pretrain including constantly updated survey and paperlist.",2022-09-14,2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3560815,3108,0,0.7454276369171933,"['Pengfei Liu', 'Weizhe Yuan', 'Jinlan Fu', 'Zhengbao Jiang', 'Hiroaki Hayashi', 'Graham Neubig']",,True
SegFormer: Simple and Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation with\n Transformers,"We present SegFormer, a simple, efficient yet powerful semantic segmentation\nframework which unifies Transformers with lightweight multilayer perception\n(MLP) decoders. SegFormer has two appealing features: 1) SegFormer comprises a\nnovel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale\nfeatures. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the\ninterpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the\ntesting resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders.\nThe proposed MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus\ncombining both local attention and global attention to render powerful\nrepresentations. We show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to\nefficient segmentation on Transformers. We scale our approach up to obtain a\nseries of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly\nbetter performance and efficiency than previous counterparts. For example,\nSegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3% mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5x\nsmaller and 2.2% better than the previous best method.

Instant neural graphics primitives with a multiresolution hash encoding,"Neural graphics primitives, parameterized by fully connected neural networks, can be costly to train and evaluate. We reduce this cost with a versatile new input encoding that permits the use of a smaller network without sacrificing quality, thus significantly reducing the number of floating point and memory access operations: a small neural network is augmented by a multiresolution hash table of trainable feature vectors whose values are optimized through stochastic gradient descent. The multiresolution structure allows the network to disambiguate hash collisions, making for a simple architecture that is trivial to parallelize on modern GPUs. We leverage this parallelism by implementing the whole system using fully-fused CUDA kernels with a focus on minimizing wasted bandwidth and compute operations.

This diversity within the method of TA is typically poorly understood and rarely acknowledged, resulting in the frequent publication of research lacking in design coherence. Furthermore, because TA offers researchers something closer to a method (a trans-theoretical tool or technique) rather than a methodology (a theoretically-informed framework for research), one with considerable theoretical and design flexibility, researchers need to engage in careful conceptual and design thinking to produce TA research with methodological integrity. In this paper, we support researchers in their conceptual and design thinking for TA, and particularly for the reflexive approach we have developed, by guiding them through the conceptual underpinnings of different approaches to TA, and key design considerations. We outline our typology of three main “schools” of TA – coding reliability, codebook and reflexive – and consider how these differ in their conceptual underpinnings, with a particular focus on the distinct characteristics of our reflexive approach. We discuss key areas of design – research questions, data collection, participant/data item selection strategy and criteria, ethics, and quality standards and practices – and end with guidance on reporting standards for reflexive TA.",2021-05-13,2021,https://doi.org/10.1037/qup0000196,3085,2,1.0,"['Virginia Braun', 'Victoria Clarke']",,False
Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association,"The global obesity epidemic is well established, with increases in obesity prevalence for most countries since the 1980s. Obesity contributes directly to incident cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and sleep disorders. Obesity also leads to the development of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors. More recent data highlight abdominal obesity, as determined by waist circumference, as a cardiovascular disease risk marker that is independent of body mass index. There have also been significant advances in imaging modalities for characterizing body composition, including visceral adiposity. Studies that quantify fat depots, including ectopic fat, support excess visceral adiposity as an independent indicator of poor cardiovascular outcomes. Lifestyle modification and subsequent weight loss improve both metabolic syndrome and associated systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. However, clinical trials of medical weight loss have not demonstrated a reduction in coronary artery disease rates. In contrast, prospective studies comparing patients undergoing bariatric surgery with nonsurgical patients with obesity have shown reduced coronary artery disease risk with surgery. In this statement, we summarize the impact of obesity on the diagnosis, clinical management, and outcomes of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias, especially sudden cardiac death and atrial fibrillation. In particular, we examine the influence of obesity on noninvasive and invasive diagnostic procedures for coronary artery disease. Moreover, we review the impact of obesity on cardiac function and outcomes related to heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. Finally, we describe the effects of lifestyle and surgical weight loss interventions on outcomes related to coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.",2021-04-22,2021,https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000973,3043,1,0.4494967679603796,"['Tiffany M.

Effectiveness of Covid-19 Vaccines against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant,Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the delta variant as compared with the alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked after the receipt of the first dose. This finding would support efforts to maximize vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable populations.

Exploring Simple Siamese Representation Learning,"Siamese networks have become a common structure in various recent models for unsupervised visual representation learning. These models maximize the similarity between two augmentations of one image, subject to certain conditions for avoiding collapsing solutions. In this paper, we report surprising empirical results that simple Siamese networks can learn meaningful representations even using none of the following: (i) negative sample pairs, (ii) large batches, (iii) momentum encoders. Our experiments show that collapsing solutions do exist for the loss and structure, but a stop-gradient operation plays an essential role in preventing collapsing. We provide a hypothesis on the implication of stop-gradient, and further show proof-of-concept experiments verifying it. Our ""SimSiam"" method achieves competitive results on ImageNet and downstream tasks. We hope this simple baseline will motivate people to rethink the roles of Siamese architectures for unsupervised representation learning.

<i>Gaia</i> Data Release 3,"Context. We present the third data release of the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission, Gaia DR3. This release includes a large variety of new data products, notably a much expanded radial velocity survey and a very extensive astrophysical characterisation of Gaia sources. Aims. We outline the content and the properties of Gaia DR3, providing an overview of the main improvements in the data processing in comparison with previous data releases (where applicable) and a brief discussion of the limitations of the data in this release. Methods. The Gaia DR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium. Results. The Gaia DR3 catalogue contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and broad band photometry in the G , G BP , and G RP pass-bands already present in the Early Third Data Release, Gaia EDR3. Gaia DR3 introduces an impressive wealth of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges G RVS &lt; 14 and 3100 &lt; T eff &lt; 14 500, have new determinations of their mean radial velocities based on data collected by Gaia . We provide G RVS magnitudes for most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed for a subset of these. Mean Gaia spectra are made available to the community. The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism photometer BP/RP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. Gaia DR3 includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470 million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some 800 000 astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than 150 000 Solar System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra derived from the epoch BP/RP spectral data are published for about 60 000 asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey, consisting of the photometric time series for all sources located in a 5.5 degree radius field centred on the Andromeda galaxy. Conclusions. This data release represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR2 and Gaia EDR3 because of the unprecedented quantity, quality, and variety of source astrophysical data. To date this is the largest collection of all-sky spectrophotometry, radial velocities, variables, and astrophysical parameters derived from both low- and high-resolution spectra and includes a spectrophotometric and dynamical survey of SSOs of the highest accuracy. The non-single star content surpasses the existing data by orders of magnitude. The quasar host and galaxy light profile collection is the first such survey that is all sky and space based. The astrophysical information provided in Gaia DR3 will unleash the full potential of Gaia ’s exquisite astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity surveys.",2022-06-10,2022,https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202243940,2981,6,0.6087881704041941,"['A.

"Opinion Paper: “So what if ChatGPT wrote it?” Multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI for research, practice and policy","Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts. 2023 The Authors",2023-03-11,2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2023.102642,2968,2,0.4214845195834457,"['Yogesh K.

Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection,"Variable memory Immune memory against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) helps to determine protection against reinfection, disease risk, and vaccine efficacy. Using 188 human cases across the range of severity of COVID-19, Dan et al. analyzed cross-sectional data describing the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells, CD8 + T cells, and CD4 + T cells for more than 6 months after infection. The authors found a high degree of heterogeneity in the magnitude of adaptive immune responses that persisted into the immune memory phase to the virus. However, immune memory in three immunological compartments remained measurable in greater than 90% of subjects for more than 5 months after infection. Despite the heterogeneity of immune responses, these results show that durable immunity against secondary COVID-19 disease is a possibility for most individuals.

3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering,"Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow high-quality real-time (≥ 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution. First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering.

Restormer: Efficient Transformer for High-Resolution Image Restoration,"Since convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform well at learning generalizable image priors from large-scale data, these models have been extensively applied to image restoration and related tasks. Recently, another class of neural architectures, Transformers, have shown significant performance gains on natural language and high-level vision tasks. While the Transformer model mitigates the shortcomings of CNNs (i.e., limited receptive field and inadaptability to input content), its computational complexity grows quadratically with the spatial resolution, therefore making it infeasible to apply to most image restoration tasks involving high-resolution images. In this work, we propose an efficient Transformer model by making several key designs in the building blocks (multi-head attention and feed-forward network) such that it can capture long-range pixel interactions, while still remaining applicable to large images. Our model, named Restoration Transformer (Restormer), achieves state-of-the-art results on several image restoration tasks, including image deraining, single-image motion deblurring, defocus deblurring (single-image and dual-pixel data), and image denoising (Gaussian grayscale/color denoising, and real image denoising).

Changing profiles of cancer burden worldwide and in China: a secondary analysis of the global cancer statistics 2020,"Abstract Background: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally, but its burden is not uniform. GLOBOCAN 2020 has newly updated the estimates of cancer burden. This study summarizes the most recent changing profiles of cancer burden worldwide and in China and compares the cancer data of China with those of other regions. Methods: We conducted a descriptive secondary analysis of the GLOBOCAN 2020 data. To depict the changing global profile of the leading cancer types in 2020 compared with 2018, we extracted the numbers of cases and deaths in 2018 from GLOBOCAN 2018. We also obtained cancer incidence and mortality from the 2015 National Cancer Registry Report in China when sorting the leading cancer types by new cases and deaths. For the leading cancer types according to sex in China, we summarized the estimated numbers of incidence and mortality, and calculated China's percentage of the global new cases and deaths. Results: Breast cancer displaced lung cancer to become the most leading diagnosed cancer worldwide in 2020. Lung, liver, stomach, breast, and colon cancers were the top five leading causes of cancer-related death, among which liver cancer changed from the third-highest cancer mortality in 2018 to the second-highest in 2020. China accounted for 24% of newly diagnosed cases and 30% of the cancer-related deaths worldwide in 2020. Among the 185 countries included in the database, China's age-standardized incidence rate (204.8 per 100,000) ranked 65th and the age-standardized mortality rate (129.4 per 100,000) ranked 13th. The two rates were above the global average. Lung cancer remained the most common cancer type and the leading cause of cancer death in China. However, breast cancer became the most frequent cancer type among women if the incidence was stratified by sex. Incidences of colorectal cancer and breast cancer increased rapidly. The leading causes of cancer death varied minimally in ranking from 2015 to 2020 in China. Gastrointestinal cancers, including stomach, colorectal, liver, and esophageal cancers, contributed to a massive burden of cancer for both sexes. Conclusions: The burden of breast cancer is increasing globally. China is undergoing cancer transition with an increasing burden of lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and breast cancers. The mortality rate of cancer in China is high. Comprehensive strategies are urgently needed to target China's changing profiles of the cancer burden.",2021-03-04,2021,https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000001474,2814,3,0.6399352066909202,"['Wei Cao', 'Hongda Chen', 'Yiwen Yu', 'Ni Li', 'Wanqing Chen']",,True
Acta Palaeontologica Polonica,"Caudipteryx zoui is a small enigmatic theropod known from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of the People's Republic of China. From the time of its initial description, this taxon has stimulated a great deal of ongoing debate regarding the phylogenetic relationship between non-avialan theropods and birds (Avialae) because it preserves structures that have been uncontroversially accepted as feathers (albeit aerodynamically unsuitable for flight). However, it has also been proposed that both the relative proportions of the hind limb bones (when compared with overall leg length), and the position of the center of mass in Caudipteryx are more similar to those seen in extant cusorial birds than they are to other non-avialan theropod dinosaurs. This conclusion has been used to imply that Caudipteryx may not have been correctly interpreted as a feathered non-avialan theropod, but instead that this taxon represents some kind of flightless bird. We review the evidence for this claim at the level of both the included fossil specimen data, and in terms of the validity of the results presented.

Independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld partition: A new method for visual study of interactions in chemical systems,"Abstract The powerful independent gradient model (IGM) method has been increasingly popular in visual analysis of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions in recent years. However, we frequently observed that there is an evident shortcoming of IGM map in graphically studying weak interactions, that is its isosurfaces are usually too bulgy; in these cases, not only the graphical effect is poor, but also the color on some areas on the isosurfaces is inappropriate and may lead to erroneous analysis conclusions. In addition, the IGM method was originally proposed based on promolecular density, which is quite crude and does not take actual electronic structure into account. In this article, we propose an improvement version of IGM, namely IGM based on Hirshfeld partition of molecular density (IGMH), which replaces the free‐state atomic densities involved in the IGM method with the atomic densities derived by Hirshfeld partition of actual molecular electron density. This change makes IGM have more rigorous physical background. A large number of application examples in this article, including molecular and periodic systems, weak and chemical bond interactions, fully demonstrate the important value of IGMH in intuitively understanding interactions in chemical systems. Comparisons also showed that the IGMH usually has markedly better graphical effect than IGM and overcomes known problems in IGM. Currently IGMH analysis has been supported in our wavefunction analysis code Multiwfn ( http://sobereva.com/multiwfn ). We hope that IGMH will become a new useful method among chemists for exploring interactions in wide variety of chemical systems.",2022-02-02,2022,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.26812,2735,4,1.0,"['Tian Lu', 'Qinxue Chen']",,False

2023 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures,"Abstract This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease, including prevalence and incidence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on family caregivers, the dementia workforce and society. The Special Report examines the patient journey from awareness of cognitive changes to potential treatment with drugs that change the underlying biology of Alzheimer's. An estimated 6.7 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, and Alzheimer's disease was officially listed as the sixth‐leading cause of death in the United States. In 2020 and 2021, when COVID‐19 entered the ranks of the top ten causes of death, Alzheimer's was the seventh‐leading cause of death. Alzheimer's remains the fifth‐leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145%. This trajectory of deaths from AD was likely exacerbated by the COVID‐19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2022. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $339.5 billion in 2022. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers’ increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes — costs that have been aggravated by COVID‐19. Members of the paid health care workforce are involved in diagnosing, treating and caring for people with dementia. In recent years, however, a shortage of such workers has developed in the United States. This shortage — brought about, in part, by COVID‐19 — has occurred at a time when more members of the dementia care workforce are needed. Therefore, programs will be needed to attract workers and better train health care teams. Average per‐person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are almost three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 22 times as great. Total payments in 2023 for health care, long‐term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $345 billion. The Special Report examines whether there will be sufficient numbers of physician specialists to provide Alzheimer's care and treatment now that two drugs are available that change the underlying biology of Alzheimer's disease.",2023-03-14,2023,https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.13016,2711,1,1.0,[],,True

Applied Mathematical Sciences,"In order to study the problem of detecting an optimal sequence of random audits, this paper is devoted to determine a checking schedule minimizing the expected total cost resulting from the inspections and the possible first failure. This problem is considered in the general case in which the number of checks during an interval is described by a Poisson checking process: in the framework of the Optimal Control Theory, the analytical solution of a new problem which is related to that of detecting the optimal random audit scheme is characterized. This is achievable because in this case the control function is associated to the rate of growth of the checking intensity. In particular, the proposed representation leads to the explicit detection of the (sub-)optimal solution for exponential or uniform failure density functions and it ensures the analysis of the optimal solution dynamic in the phase-diagram framework.",2021-12-19,2021,https://doi.org/10.12988/ams,2665,0,0.26906803990929185,"['Paolo De Angelis', 'Roberto De Marchis', 'Antonio Martire', 'Stefano Patrì']",,True

Adding Conditional Control to Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"We present ControlNet, a neural network architecture to add spatial conditioning controls to large, pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. ControlNet locks the production-ready large diffusion models, and reuses their deep and robust encoding layers pretrained with billions of images as a strong backbone to learn a diverse set of conditional controls. The neural architecture is connected with ""zero convolutions""(zero-initialized convolution layers) that progressively grow the parameters from zero and ensure that no harmful noise could affect the finetuning. We test various conditioning controls, e.g., edges, depth, segmentation, human pose, etc., with Stable Diffusion, using single or multiple conditions, with or without prompts. We show that the training of ControlNets is robust with small (&lt;50k) and large (&gt;1m) datasets.

Biological structure and function emerge from scaling unsupervised learning to 250 million protein sequences,"Significance Learning biological properties from sequence data is a logical step toward generative and predictive artificial intelligence for biology. Here, we propose scaling a deep contextual language model with unsupervised learning to sequences spanning evolutionary diversity.

We show the learned representations are useful across benchmarks for remote homology detection, prediction of secondary structure, long-range residue–residue contacts, and mutational effect.

The 30 m annual land cover dataset and its dynamics in China from 1990 to 2019,"Abstract. Land cover (LC) determines the energy exchange, water and carbon cycle between Earth's spheres. Accurate LC information is a fundamental parameter for the environment and climate studies. Considering that the LC in China has been altered dramatically with the economic development in the past few decades, sequential and fine-scale LC monitoring is in urgent need. However, currently, fine-resolution annual LC dataset produced by the observational images is generally unavailable for China due to the lack of sufficient training samples and computational capabilities. To deal with this issue, we produced the first Landsat-derived annual China land cover dataset (CLCD) on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which contains 30 m annual LC and its dynamics in China from 1990 to 2019. We first collected the training samples by combining stable samples extracted from China's land-use/cover datasets (CLUDs) and visually interpreted samples from satellite time-series data, Google Earth and Google Maps. Using 335 709 Landsat images on the GEE, several temporal metrics were constructed and fed to the random forest classifier to obtain classification results. We then proposed a post-processing method incorporating spatial–temporal filtering and logical reasoning to further improve the spatial–temporal consistency of CLCD. Finally, the overall accuracy of CLCD reached 79.31 % based on 5463 visually interpreted samples. A further assessment based on 5131 third-party test samples showed that the overall accuracy of CLCD outperforms that of MCD12Q1, ESACCI_LC, FROM_GLC and GlobeLand30. Besides, we intercompared the CLCD with several Landsat-derived thematic products, which exhibited good consistencies with the Global Forest Change, the Global Surface Water, and three impervious surface products. Based on the CLCD, the trends and patterns of China's LC changes during 1985 and 2019 were revealed, such as expansion of impervious surface (+148.71 %) and water (+18.39 %), decrease in cropland (−4.85 %) and grassland (−3.29 %), and increase in forest (+4.34 %). In general, CLCD reflected the rapid urbanization and a series of ecological projects (e.g. Gain for Green) in China and revealed the anthropogenic implications on LC under the condition of climate change, signifying its potential application in the global change research.

Estimated transmissibility and impact of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in England,"UK variant transmission Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the capacity to generate variants with major genomic changes. The UK variant B.1.1.7 (also known as VOC 202012/01) has many mutations that alter virus attachment and entry into human cells. Using a variety of statistical and dynamic modeling approaches, Davies et al. characterized the spread of the B.1.1.7 variant in the United Kingdom. The authors found that the variant is 43 to 90% more transmissible than the predecessor lineage but saw no clear evidence for a change in disease severity, although enhanced transmission will lead to higher incidence and more hospital admissions. Large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur after the easing of control measures, and it may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to control the epidemic.

"Toxic Mechanisms of Five Heavy Metals: Mercury, Lead, Chromium, Cadmium, and Arsenic","The industrial activities of the last century have caused massive increases in human exposure to heavy metals. Mercury, lead, chromium, cadmium, and arsenic have been the most common heavy metals that induced human poisonings. Here, we reviewed the mechanistic action of these heavy metals according to the available animal and human studies. Acute or chronic poisonings may occur following exposure through water, air, and food. Bioaccumulation of these heavy metals leads to a diversity of toxic effects on a variety of body tissues and organs. Heavy metals disrupt cellular events including growth, proliferation, differentiation, damage-repairing processes, and apoptosis. Comparison of the mechanisms of action reveals similar pathways for these metals to induce toxicity including ROS generation, weakening of the antioxidant defense, enzyme inactivation, and oxidative stress. On the other hand, some of them have selective binding to specific macromolecules. The interaction of lead with aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ferrochelatase is within this context. Reactions of other heavy metals with certain proteins were discussed as well. Some toxic metals including chromium, cadmium, and arsenic cause genomic instability. Defects in DNA repair following the induction of oxidative stress and DNA damage by the three metals have been considered as the cause of their carcinogenicity. Even with the current knowledge of hazards of heavy metals, the incidence of poisoning remains considerable and requires preventive and effective treatment. The application of chelation therapy for the management of metal poisoning could be another aspect of heavy metals to be reviewed in the future.",2021-04-13,2021,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.643972,2494,-1,0.17046263552703275,"['Mahdi Balali‐Mood', 'Kobra Naseri', 'Zoya Tahergorabi', 'Mohammad Reza Khazdair', 'Mahmood Sadeghi']",,True

Minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles (MISEV2023): From basic to advanced approaches,"Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EVs), through their complex cargo, can reflect the state of their cell of origin and change the functions and phenotypes of other cells. These features indicate strong biomarker and therapeutic potential and have generated broad interest, as evidenced by the steady year‐on‐year increase in the numbers of scientific publications about EVs. Important advances have been made in EV metrology and in understanding and applying EV biology. However, hurdles remain to realising the potential of EVs in domains ranging from basic biology to clinical applications due to challenges in EV nomenclature, separation from non‐vesicular extracellular particles, characterisation and functional studies. To address the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) updates its ‘Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles’, which was first published in 2014 and then in 2018 as MISEV2014 and MISEV2018, respectively. The goal of the current document, MISEV2023, is to provide researchers with an updated snapshot of available approaches and their advantages and limitations for production, separation and characterisation of EVs from multiple sources, including cell culture, body fluids and solid tissues. In addition to presenting the latest state of the art in basic principles of EV research, this document also covers advanced techniques and approaches that are currently expanding the boundaries of the field. MISEV2023 also includes new sections on EV release and uptake and a brief discussion of in vivo approaches to study EVs. Compiling feedback from ISEV expert task forces and more than 1000 researchers, this document conveys the current state of EV research to facilitate robust scientific discoveries and move the field forward even more rapidly.",2024-02-01,2024,https://doi.org/10.1002/jev2.12404,2446,3,1.0,"['Joshua A Welsh', 'Deborah C.

BioMed Research International,"Introduction. We present our experience with hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) versus cold storage (CS) in relation to kidney transplant outcomes. Methods. Retrospective analysis of 33 consecutive HMP kidney transplant outcomes matched with those of 33 cold stored: delayed graft function (DGF), length of hospital stay (LOS), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and patient and graft survival were compared. Renal Resistive Indexes (RIs) during HMP in relation to DGF were also analysed. Results. In the HMP group, mean HMP time was 5.7 ± 3.9 hours with a mean cold ischaemic time (CIT) of 15 ± 5.6 versus 15.1 ± 5.3 hours in the CS group. DGF was lower in the HMP group (p=0.041), and donation after Circulatory Death (DCD) was a predictor for DGF (p&lt;0.01). HMP decreased DGF in DCD grafts (p=0.036). Patient and graft survival were similar, but eGFR at 365 days was higher in the HMP cohort (p&lt;0.001). RIs decreased during HMP (p&lt;0.01); 2-hours RI ≥ 0.45 mmHg/mL/min predicted DGF in DCD kidneys (75% sensitivity, 80% specificity; area under the curve 0.78); 2-hours RI ≥ 0.2 mmHg/ml/min predicted DGF in DBD grafts (sensitivity 100%, specificity 91%; area under the curve 0.87). Conclusion. HMP decreased DGF compared to CS, offering viability assessment pretransplant and improving one-year renal function of the grafts.",2022-09-19,2022,https://doi.org/10.1155/2738,2439,1,0.2976995691790018,"['Maria Irene Bellini', 'Sotiris Charalampidis', 'Paul Herbert', 'Vasileios Bonatsos', 'Jeremy Crane', 'Anand Muthusamy', 'Frank J.

CBTRUS Statistical Report: Primary Brain and Other Central Nervous System Tumors Diagnosed in the United States in 2014–2018,"Abstract The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS), in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Cancer Institute (NCI), is the largest population-based cancer registry focused exclusively on primary brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tumors in the United States (US) and represents the entire US population. This report contains the most up-to-date population-based data on primary brain tumors available and supersedes all previous reports in terms of completeness and accuracy and is the first CBTRUS Report to provide the distribution of molecular markers for selected brain and CNS tumor histologies. All rates are age-adjusted using the 2000 US standard population and presented per 100,000 population. The average annual age-adjusted incidence rate (AAAIR) of all malignant and non-malignant brain and other CNS tumors was 24.25 (Malignant AAAIR=7.06, Non-malignant AAAIR=17.18). This overall rate was higher in females compared to males (26.95 versus 21.35) and non-Hispanics compared to Hispanics (24.68 versus 22.12). The most commonly occurring malignant brain and other CNS tumor was glioblastoma (14.3% of all tumors and 49.1% of malignant tumors), and the most common non-malignant tumor was meningioma (39.0% of all tumors and 54.5% of non-malignant tumors). Glioblastoma was more common in males, and meningioma was more common in females. In children and adolescents (age 0–19 years), the incidence rate of all primary brain and other CNS tumors was 6.21. An estimated 88,190 new cases of malignant and non-malignant brain and other CNS tumors are expected to be diagnosed in the US population in 2021 (25,690 malignant and 62,500 non-malignant). There were 83,029 deaths attributed to malignant brain and other CNS tumors between 2014 and 2018. This represents an average annual mortality rate of 4.43 per 100,000 and an average of 16,606 deaths per year. The five-year relative survival rate following diagnosis of a malignant brain and other CNS tumor was 35.6%, for a non-malignant brain and other CNS tumors the five-year relative survival rate was 91.8%.",2021-10-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/noab200,2424,-1,0.3966228148512261,"['Quinn T.

Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine,"The control of gastrointestinal parasites in livestock relies almost exclusively on multiple and regular dosing with anthelmintics. That involves in problems linked with residues in food products and environment encouraging researchers in studying alternatives or new helminth control methods (Ketzis et al., 2006). Among these, homeopathy could play a strategic role in solving health problems; however, at present, there is a lack of scientific results with validated techniques used on a large scale. In consequence of these considerations, the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of homeopathy in the control of parasite burden in sheep.\n\n\n\nThe study lasted 12 months and involved 30 ewes of Zerasca breed divided in two groups. Sabadilla MK was administered twice. Gastrointestinal strongyles faecal egg count (FEC) and blood parameters were performed. Statistical analysis was carried out by ANOVA and relations between FEC and hematocrit (HCT) were estimated by Pearson’s correlations. FEC resulted influenced by the date of sampling, confirming a fluctuation linked with the season. Homeopathy did not influence parasite burden in the whole, but a significant decrease (p≤0.05) in egg output was observed at the second and at the last sampling following the administration of the remedy. Data referring blood parameters did not show appreciable differences between the two groups.

Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity,"The incidence of chronic diseases (CDs), including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, has increased over the last few decades. CDs are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide.\nAt the molecular level, overactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multi-protein complex consisting of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1, has been linked to the development of many CDs. The NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by high glucose, palmitate, cholesterol crystals, ceramide, C-reactive protein, and islet amyloid polypeptide under damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), resulting in caspase-1 cleavage and production of mature IL-1β. IL-1β-induced chronic inflammation may result in damage to the host and eventually lead to the development of CDs. Specifically, DAMPs induce the overproduction of ROS, leading to thioredoxin (TRX)-interacting protein (TXNIP) to dissociate from TRX and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Accumulating evidence has suggested that ROS-generating mitochondria lead to spontaneous NLRP3 inflammasome activation, exacerbating inflammatory responses through multiple downstream events, such as an impairing insulin signal transduction associated with insulin resistance. Targeting the aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induced by ROS under DAMPs represents an emerging therapeutic target for CDs.",2022-09-19,2022,https://doi.org/10.1155/2572,2414,3,0.8273296806186597,"['Tao Zheng', 'Fang Bian', 'Juyi Li', 'Francesca Danesi']",,False

Global burden of heart failure: a comprehensive and updated review of epidemiology,"Abstract Heart Failure (HF) is a multi-faceted and life-threatening syndrome characterized by significant morbidity and mortality, poor functional capacity and quality of life, and high costs. HF affects more than 64 million people worldwide. Therefore, attempts to decrease its social and economic burden have become a major global public health priority. While the incidence of HF has stabilized and seems to be declining in industrialized countries, the prevalence is increasing due to the ageing of the population, improved treatment of and survival with ischaemic heart disease, and the availability of effective evidence-based therapies prolonging life in patients with HF. There are geographical variations in HF epidemiology. There is substantial lack of data from developing countries, where HF exhibits different features compared with that observed in the Western world.

Survey of Hallucination in Natural Language Generation,"Natural Language Generation (NLG) has improved exponentially in recent years thanks to the development of sequence-to-sequence deep learning technologies such as Transformer-based language models. This advancement has led to more fluent and coherent NLG, leading to improved development in downstream tasks such as abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, and data-to-text generation. However, it is also apparent that deep learning based generation is prone to hallucinate unintended text, which degrades the system performance and fails to meet user expectations in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue, many studies have been presented in measuring and mitigating hallucinated texts, but these have never been reviewed in a comprehensive manner before. In this survey, we thus provide a broad overview of the research progress and challenges in the hallucination problem in NLG. The survey is organized into two parts: (1) a general overview of metrics, mitigation methods, and future directions, and (2) an overview of task-specific research progress on hallucinations in the following downstream tasks, namely abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, generative question answering, data-to-text generation, and machine translation.

Understanding the Impact of Value Selection Heuristics in Scheduling Problems,"It has been observed that value selection heuristics have less impact than other heuristic choices when solving hard combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. It is often thought that this is because more time is spent on unsatisfiable sub-problems where the value ordering is irrelevant. In this paper we investigate this belief in the scheduling domain and come up with a more detailed explanation. We find that, even though there are less relevant choices to be made on hard instances, each mistake tends to have a bigger impact, to a point where the potential gain from a value heuristic predominates. Moreover, we observe two interesting and relatively surprising phenomena when solving scheduling problems. First, the accuracy of a given value selection heuristic decreases with the optimality gap. Second, the computational penalty of a mistake increases with the accuracy of the heuristic. For the first observation, we argue that on hard problems, constraint propagation removes a large portion of choices that align with the intuition behind the heuristic. This means that the heuristic faces mostly difficult choices. For the second observation, we argue that simple heuristics tend to make more mistakes on intuitive choice points, and the computational cost for refuting these mistakes is smaller than for those made by a more accurate heuristic.",2025-01-01,2025,https://doi.org/10.4230/lipics.cp.2025.27,2380,0,0.40647325626010006,"['Peter Battaglia', 'Jessica B.

Microbiota in health and diseases,"Abstract The role of microbiota in health and diseases is being highlighted by numerous studies since its discovery. Depending on the localized regions, microbiota can be classified into gut, oral, respiratory, and skin microbiota. The microbial communities are in symbiosis with the host, contributing to homeostasis and regulating immune function. However, microbiota dysbiosis can lead to dysregulation of bodily functions and diseases including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, respiratory diseases, etc. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of how microbiota links to host health or pathogenesis. We first summarize the research of microbiota in healthy conditions, including the gut-brain axis, colonization resistance and immune modulation. Then, we highlight the pathogenesis of microbiota dysbiosis in disease development and progression, primarily associated with dysregulation of community composition, modulation of host immune response, and induction of chronic inflammation.

"ChatGPT Utility in Healthcare Education, Research, and Practice: Systematic Review on the Promising Perspectives and Valid Concerns","ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based conversational large language model (LLM). The potential applications of LLMs in health care education, research, and practice could be promising if the associated valid concerns are proactively examined and addressed. The current systematic review aimed to investigate the utility of ChatGPT in health care education, research, and practice and to highlight its potential limitations. Using the PRIMSA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted to retrieve English records in PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar (published research or preprints) that examined ChatGPT in the context of health care education, research, or practice. A total of 60 records were eligible for inclusion. Benefits of ChatGPT were cited in 51/60 (85.0%) records and included: (1) improved scientific writing and enhancing research equity and versatility; (2) utility in health care research (efficient analysis of datasets, code generation, literature reviews, saving time to focus on experimental design, and drug discovery and development); (3) benefits in health care practice (streamlining the workflow, cost saving, documentation, personalized medicine, and improved health literacy); and (4) benefits in health care education including improved personalized learning and the focus on critical thinking and problem-based learning. Concerns regarding ChatGPT use were stated in 58/60 (96.7%) records including ethical, copyright, transparency, and legal issues, the risk of bias, plagiarism, lack of originality, inaccurate content with risk of hallucination, limited knowledge, incorrect citations, cybersecurity issues, and risk of infodemics. The promising applications of ChatGPT can induce paradigm shifts in health care education, research, and practice. However, the embrace of this AI chatbot should be conducted with extreme caution considering its potential limitations. As it currently stands, ChatGPT does not qualify to be listed as an author in scientific articles unless the ICMJE/COPE guidelines are revised or amended.

Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (4th edition)<sup>1</sup>,"In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for <i>bona fide</i> autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.",2021-01-02,2021,https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2020.1797280,2366,-1,0.07594189530456716,"['Daniel J.

"A Survey on Knowledge Graphs: Representation, Acquisition, and Applications","Human knowledge provides a formal understanding of the world. Knowledge graphs that represent structural relations between entities have become an increasingly popular research direction toward cognition and human-level intelligence. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the knowledge graph covering overall research topics about: 1) knowledge graph representation learning; 2) knowledge acquisition and completion; 3) temporal knowledge graph; and 4) knowledge-aware applications and summarize recent breakthroughs and perspective directions to facilitate future research. We propose a full-view categorization and new taxonomies on these topics. Knowledge graph embedding is organized from four aspects of representation space, scoring function, encoding models, and auxiliary information. For knowledge acquisition, especially knowledge graph completion, embedding methods, path inference, and logical rule reasoning are reviewed. We further explore several emerging topics, including metarelational learning, commonsense reasoning, and temporal knowledge graphs. To facilitate future research on knowledge graphs, we also provide a curated collection of data sets and open-source libraries on different tasks. In the end, we have a thorough outlook on several promising research directions.",2021-04-26,2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2021.3070843,2360,-1,0.18510670789402606,"['Shaoxiong Ji', 'Shirui Pan', 'Erik Cambria', 'Pekka Marttinen', 'Philip S.

The strengths perspective in social work practice,"Over the last 30 years or so, the strengths perspective has been fundamental in helping to develop a social work practice that is both person-centred and empowering; one of its key proponents throughout this time has been Dennis Saleebey (1936–2014). In this article, Saleebey sets out the main characteristics of the strengths perspective. He also, however, takes on its critics – those who suggest that strengths-based approaches offer too rosy a view of human nature, or that it is too simplistic in its assumptions about the essential good in people. Our chosen extract focuses not on the critics, but on the detailed introduction that Saleebey offers of this life-affirming, positive and ultimately optimistic approach to the task of social work.",2023-02-13,2023,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003178699-44,2357,2,0.38684301440980673,['Dennis Saleebey'],,False
Global prevalence of autism: A systematic review update,"Abstract Prevalence estimates of autism are essential for informing public policy, raising awareness, and developing research priorities. Using a systematic review, we synthesized estimates of the prevalence of autism worldwide. We examined factors accounting for variability in estimates and critically reviewed evidence relevant for hypotheses about biological or social determinants (viz., biological sex, sociodemographic status, ethnicity/race, and nativity) potentially modifying prevalence estimates of autism. We performed the search in November 2021 within Medline for studies estimating autism prevalence, published since our last systematic review in 2012. Data were extracted by two independent researchers. Since 2012, 99 estimates from 71 studies were published indicating a global autism prevalence that ranges within and across regions, with a median prevalence of 100/10,000 (range: 1.09/10,000 to 436.0/10,000). The median male‐to‐female ratio was 4.2. The median percentage of autism cases with co‐occurring intellectual disability was 33.0%. Estimates varied, likely reflecting complex and dynamic interactions between patterns of community awareness, service capacity, help seeking, and sociodemographic factors. A limitation of this review is that synthesizing methodological features precludes a quality appraisal of studies. Our findings reveal an increase in measured autism prevalence globally, reflecting the combined effects of multiple factors including the increase in community awareness and public health response globally, progress in case identification and definition, and an increase in community capacity. Hypotheses linking factors that increase the likelihood of developing autism with variations in prevalence will require research with large, representative samples and comparable autism diagnostic criteria and case‐finding methods in diverse world regions over time. Lay Summary We reviewed studies of the prevalence of autism worldwide, considering the impact of geographic, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors on prevalence estimates. Approximately 1/100 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder around the world. Prevalence estimates increased over time and varied greatly within and across sociodemographic groups. These findings reflect changes in the definition of autism and differences in the methodology and contexts of prevalence studies.",2022-03-03,2022,https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2696,2346,1,0.7034461557259124,"['Jinan Zeidan', 'Éric Fombonne', 'Julie Scorah', 'Alaa T.

"<i>PRISMA2020</i> : An R package and Shiny app for producing PRISMA 2020‐compliant flow diagrams, with interactivity for optimised digital transparency and Open Synthesis","Abstract Background Reporting standards, such as PRISMA aim to ensure that the methods and results of systematic reviews are described in sufficient detail to allow full transparency. Flow diagrams in evidence syntheses allow the reader to rapidly understand the core procedures used in a review and examine the attrition of irrelevant records throughout the review process. Recent research suggests that use of flow diagrams in systematic reviews is poor and of low quality and called for standardised templates to facilitate better reporting in flow diagrams. The increasing options for interactivity provided by the Internet gives us an opportunity to support easy‐to‐use evidence synthesis tools, and here we report on the development of a tool for the production of PRISMA 2020‐compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Methods and Findings We developed a free‐to‐use, Open Source R package and web‐based Shiny app to allow users to design PRISMA flow diagrams for their own systematic reviews. Our tool allows users to produce standardised visualisations that transparently document the methods and results of a systematic review process in a variety of formats. In addition, we provide the opportunity to produce interactive, web‐based flow diagrams (exported as HTML files), that allow readers to click on boxes of the diagram and navigate to further details on methods, results or data files. We provide an interactive example here; https://prisma-flowdiagram.github.io/ . Conclusions We have developed a user‐friendly tool for producing PRISMA 2020‐compliant flow diagrams for users with coding experience and, importantly, for users without prior experience in coding by making use of Shiny ( https://estech.shinyapps.io/prisma_flowdiagram/ ). This free‐to‐use tool will make it easier to produce clear and PRISMA 2020‐compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Significantly, users can also produce interactive flow diagrams for the first time, allowing readers of their reviews to smoothly and swiftly explore and navigate to further details of the methods and results of a review. We believe this tool will increase use of PRISMA flow diagrams, improve the compliance and quality of flow diagrams, and facilitate strong science communication of the methods and results of systematic reviews by making use of interactivity. We encourage the systematic review community to make use of the tool, and provide feedback to streamline and improve their usability and efficiency.",2022-03-27,2022,https://doi.org/10.1002/cl2.1230,2345,2,1.0,"['Neal Haddaway', 'Matthew J.

1D convolutional neural networks and applications: A survey,"During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website. While there has not been a paper on the review of 1D CNNs and its applications in the literature, this paper fulfills this gap.",2022-04-26,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107398,2342,0,0.5228709102845209,"['Serkan Kıranyaz', 'Onur Avcı', 'Osama Abdeljaber', 'Türker İnce', 'Moncef Gabbouj', 'Daniel J.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign: International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock 2021,"INTRODUCTION Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection (1). Sepsis and septic shock are major healthcare problems, impacting millions of people around the world each year and killing between one in three and one in six of those it affects (2–4). Early identification and appropriate management in the initial hours after the development of sepsis improve outcomes. The recommendations in this document are intended to provide guidance for the clinician caring for adult patients with sepsis or septic shock in the hospital setting.

SCREENING AND EARLY TREATMENT Screening for Patients With Sepsis and Septic Shock - Recommendation 1. For hospitals and health systems, we recommend using a performance improvement program for sepsis, including sepsis screening for acutely ill, high-risk patients and standard operating procedures for treatment. Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence for screening. Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence for standard operating procedures. Rationale Sepsis performance improvement programs generally consist of sepsis screening, education, measurement of sepsis bundle performance, patient outcomes, and actions for identified opportunities (25,26). Despite some inconsistency, a meta-analysis of 50 observational studies on the effect of performance improvement programs showed that these programs were associated with better adherence to sepsis bundles along with a reduction in mortality (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.61–0.72) in patients with sepsis and septic shock (27). The specific components of performance improvement did not appear to be as important as the presence of a program that included sepsis screening and metrics. Sepsis screening tools are designed to promote early identification of sepsis and consist of manual methods or automated use of the electronic health record (EHR). There is wide variation in diagnostic accuracy of these tools with most having poor predictive values, although the use of some was associated with improvements in care processes (28–31). A variety of clinical variables and tools are used for sepsis screening, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, vital signs, signs of infection, quick Sequential Organ Failure Score (qSOFA) or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) criteria, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), or Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) (26,32). Machine learning may improve performance of screening tools, and in a meta-analysis of 42,623 patients from seven studies for predicting hospital acquired sepsis the pooled area under the receiving operating curve (SAUROC) (0.89; 95% CI, 0.86−0.92); sensitivity (81%; 95% CI, 80−81), and specificity (72%; 95% CI, 72−72) was higher for machine learning than the SAUROC for traditional screening tools such as SIRS (0.70), MEWS (0.50), and SOFA (0.78) (32). Screening tools may target patients in various locations, such as in-patient wards, emergency departments, or ICUs (28–30,32). A pooled analysis of three RCTs did not demonstrate a mortality benefit of active screening (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.51−1.58) (33–35). However, while there is wide variation in sensitivity and specificity of sepsis screening tools, they are an important component of identifying sepsis early for timely intervention. Standard operating procedures are a set of practices that specify a preferred response to specific clinical circumstances Sepsis standard operating as Early have to which a standard with components of the sepsis early and A large the between of sepsis and A of sepsis to hospitals in the in a mortality and after of sepsis with a control from other In this time mortality was lower in hospitals with higher with the sepsis bundles may a A meta-analysis of two RCTs in higher mortality (RR, 95% CI, with standard operating procedures compared with usual care, while it was in one observational 95% CI, - Recommendation 2. We recommend against using qSOFA compared with SIRS, NEWS, or MEWS as a screening tool for sepsis or septic shock. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

Here, we report recent developments with InterPro (version 90.0) and its associated software, including updates to data content and to the website. These developments extend and enrich the information provided by InterPro, and provide a more user friendly access to the data. Additionally, we have worked on adding Pfam website features to the InterPro website, as the Pfam website will be retired in late 2022. We also show that InterPro's sequence coverage has kept pace with the growth of UniProtKB. Moreover, we report the development of a card game as a method of engaging the non-scientific community.

LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models,"An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.",2021-06-17,2021,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2106.09685,2331,0,1.0,"['J.

A multisociety Delphi consensus statement on new fatty liver disease nomenclature,"The principal limitations of the terms NAFLD and NASH are the reliance on exclusionary confounder terms and the use of potentially stigmatising language. This study set out to determine if content experts and patient advocates were in favor of a change in nomenclature and/or definition. A modified Delphi process was led by three large pan-national liver associations. The consensus was defined a priori as a supermajority (67%) vote. An independent committee of experts external to the nomenclature process made the final recommendation on the acronym and its diagnostic criteria. A total of 236 panelists from 56 countries participated in 4 online surveys and 2 hybrid meetings. Response rates across the 4 survey rounds were 87%, 83%, 83%, and 78%, respectively. Seventy-four percent of respondents felt that the current nomenclature was sufficiently flawed to consider a name change. The terms “nonalcoholic” and “fatty” were felt to be stigmatising by 61% and 66% of respondents, respectively. Steatotic liver disease was chosen as an overarching term to encompass the various aetiologies of steatosis. The term steatohepatitis was felt to be an important pathophysiological concept that should be retained. The name chosen to replace NAFLD was metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. There was consensus to change the definition to include the presence of at least 1 of 5 cardiometabolic risk factors. Those with no metabolic parameters and no known cause were deemed to have cryptogenic steatotic liver disease. A new category, outside pure metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, termed metabolic and alcohol related/associated liver disease (MetALD), was selected to describe those with metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, who consume greater amounts of alcohol per week (140–350 g/wk and 210–420 g/wk for females and males, respectively).

Attention And Cognitive Control 1,"To what extent are our conscious intentions and strategies in control of the way information is processed in our minds? This seems to be a question of importance to us both as psychologists and as human beings. Yet as Shallice (1972) has pointed out, most theorists in psychology have avoided consideration of the relationship between conscious and unconscious mental events. While psychological writers rarely deal with this distinction directly, the reader of psychological publications can hardly avoid it. On the one hand, the pages of journals are full of studies in which the ""strategies"" or ""optional processes"" of the subject are used to explain the results obtained; on the other hand, we are told that human memory is an associational machine that operates entirely without control of the subjects' strategies (Anderson & Bower, 1973). Both of these views need to be accommodated. Even the most cognitive of theorists recognizes that people are not always able to adapt their thought processes to the strategies required by the task, and Anderson and Bower (1973) explicitly recognize that their strategy-free memory system must be coupled to other strategydependent systems.",2024-03-05,2024,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781032722450-4,2318,2,0.40897561546972383,"['Michael I.

gmx_MMPBSA: A New Tool to Perform End-State Free Energy Calculations with GROMACS,"Molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann (Generalized-Born) surface area is one of the most popular methods to estimate binding free energies. This method has been proven to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, especially when dealing with large systems. As a result of its popularity, several programs have been developed for performing MM/PB(GB)SA calculations within the GROMACS community. These programs, however, present several limitations. Here we present gmx_MMPBSA, a new tool to perform end-state free energy calculations from GROMACS molecular dynamics trajectories. gmx_MMPBSA provides the user with several options, including binding free energy calculations with different solvation models (PB, GB, or 3D-RISM), stability calculations, computational alanine scanning, entropy corrections, and binding free energy decomposition. Noteworthy, several promising methodologies to calculate relative binding free energies such as alanine scanning with variable dielectric constant and interaction entropy have also been implemented in gmx_MMPBSA. Two additional tools-gmx_MMPBSA_test and gmx_MMPBSA_ana-have been integrated within gmx_MMPBSA to improve its usability. Multiple illustrating examples can be accessed through gmx_MMPBSA_test, while gmx_MMPBSA_ana provides fast, easy, and efficient access to different graphics plotted from gmx_MMPBSA output files.

"Metaverse beyond the hype: Multidisciplinary perspectives on emerging challenges, opportunities, and agenda for research, practice and policy","The metaverse has the potential to extend the physical world using augmented and virtual reality technologies allowing users to seamlessly interact within real and simulated environments using avatars and holograms. Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and “meta…” rebranding from current reality is difficult, as “big tech” paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse.

ADMETlab 2.0: an integrated online platform for accurate and comprehensive predictions of ADMET properties,"Abstract Because undesirable pharmacokinetics and toxicity of candidate compounds are the main reasons for the failure of drug development, it has been widely recognized that absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) should be evaluated as early as possible. In silico ADMET evaluation models have been developed as an additional tool to assist medicinal chemists in the design and optimization of leads. Here, we announced the release of ADMETlab 2.0, a completely redesigned version of the widely used AMDETlab web server for the predictions of pharmacokinetics and toxicity properties of chemicals, of which the supported ADMET-related endpoints are approximately twice the number of the endpoints in the previous version, including 17 physicochemical properties, 13 medicinal chemistry properties, 23 ADME properties, 27 toxicity endpoints and 8 toxicophore rules (751 substructures). A multi-task graph attention framework was employed to develop the robust and accurate models in ADMETlab 2.0. The batch computation module was provided in response to numerous requests from users, and the representation of the results was further optimized.

SimCSE: Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings,"This paper presents SimCSE, a simple contrastive learning framework that greatly advances the state-of-the-art sentence embeddings. We first describe an unsupervised approach, which takes an input sentence and predicts itself in a contrastive objective, with only standard dropout used as noise. This simple method works surprisingly well, performing on par with previous supervised counterparts. We find that dropout acts as minimal data augmentation and removing it leads to a representation collapse. Then, we propose a supervised approach, which incorporates annotated pairs from natural language inference datasets into our contrastive learning framework, by using “entailment” pairs as positives and “contradiction” pairs as hard negatives. We evaluate SimCSE on standard semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, and our unsupervised and supervised models using BERT base achieve an average of 76.3% and 81.6% Spearman’s correlation respectively, a 4.2% and 2.2% improvement compared to previous best results. We also show—both theoretically and empirically—that contrastive learning objective regularizes pre-trained embeddings’ anisotropic space to be more uniform, and it better aligns positive pairs when supervised signals are available.",2021-01-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2021.emnlp-main.552,2286,0,0.312578369271819,"['Tianyu Gao', 'Xingcheng Yao', 'Danqi Chen']",,True

Sequence and comparative analysis of the chicken genome provide unique perspectives on vertebrate evolution,"We present here a draft genome sequence of the red jungle fowl, Gallus gallus. Because the chicken is a modern descendant of the dinosaurs and the first non-mammalian amniote to have its genome sequenced, the draft sequence of its genome - composed of approximately one billion base pairs of sequence and an estimated 20,000 - 23,000 genes - provides a new perspective on vertebrate genome evolution, while also improving the annotation of mammalian genomes. For example, the evolutionary distance between chicken and human provides high specificity in detecting functional elements, both non-coding and coding. Notably, many conserved non-coding sequences are far from genes and cannot be assigned to defined functional classes. In coding regions the evolutionary dynamics of protein domains and orthologous groups illustrate processes that distinguish the lineages leading to birds and mammals. The distinctive properties of avian microchromosomes, together with the inferred patterns of conserved synteny, provide additional insights into vertebrate chromosome architecture.",2021-03-30,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature03154,2282,-1,0.14519200784768066,"['LaDeana W.

The global epidemiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): a systematic review,"Background and Aims: NAFLD is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. We assessed the global and regional prevalence, incidence, and mortality of NAFLD using an in-depth meta-analytic approach. Approach and Results: PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE were searched for NAFLD population-based studies from 1990 to 2019 survey year (last published 2022) per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models. Bias risk assessment was per Joanna Briggs Institute. Of 2585 studies reviewed, 92 studies (N=9,361,716) met eligibility criteria. Across the study period (1990–2019), meta-analytic pooling of NAFLD prevalence estimates and ultrasound-defined NAFLD yielded an overall global prevalence of 30.05% (95% CI: 27.88%–32.32%) and 30.69% (28.4–33.09), respectively. Global NAFLD prevalence increased by +50.4% from 25.26% (21.59–29.33) in 1990–2006 to 38.00% (33.71–42.49) in 2016–2019 ( p &lt;0.001); ultrasound-defined NAFLD prevalence increased by +38.7% from 25.16% (19.46–31.87) in 1990–2006 to 34.59% (29.05–40.57) ( p =0.029). The highest NAFLD prevalence was in Latin America 44.37% (30.66%–59.00%), then Middle East and North Africa (MENA) (36.53%, 28.63%–45.22%), South Asia (33.83%, 22.91%–46.79%), South-East Asia (33.07%, 18.99%–51.03%), North America (31.20%, 25.86%–37.08%), East Asia (29.71%, 25.96%–33.76%), Asia Pacific 28.02% (24.69%–31.60%), Western Europe 25.10% (20.55%–30.28%).

UNETR: Transformers for 3D Medical Image Segmentation,"Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) with contracting and expanding paths have shown prominence for the majority of medical image segmentation applications since the past decade. In FCNNs, the encoder plays an integral role by learning both global and local features and contextual representations which can be utilized for semantic output prediction by the decoder. Despite their success, the locality of convolutional layers in FCNNs, limits the capability of learning long-range spatial dependencies. Inspired by the recent success of transformers for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in long-range sequence learning, we reformulate the task of volumetric (3D) medical image segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem. We introduce a novel architecture, dubbed as UNEt TRansformers (UNETR), that utilizes a transformer as the encoder to learn sequence representations of the input volume and effectively capture the global multi-scale information, while also following the successful ""U-shaped"" network design for the encoder and decoder. The transformer encoder is directly connected to a decoder via skip connections at different resolutions to compute the final semantic segmentation output. We have validated the performance of our method on the Multi Atlas Labeling Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV) dataset for multi-organ segmentation and the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset for brain tumor and spleen segmentation tasks.

Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,"Dimethyl selenide is the most abundant gaseous selenium species in marine environments.In this work, the value of the rate coefficient for the gas-phase reaction between dimethyl selenide and Cl atoms has been determined for the first time.The value of the second-order rate coefficient obtained was (5.0 ± 1.4) × 10 -10 cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 .The very fast nature of the reaction means that, when estimating the lifetime of dimethyl selenide in the atmosphere, loss due to reaction with Cl atoms should be considered along with loss due to reaction with O 3 and with OH and NO 3 radicals.Analysis of the available kinetic data suggests that at 760 Torr the dominant reaction pathway for the reaction of Cl atoms with dimethyl selenide will be the addition of Cl to the Se atom forming an adduct of the type CH 3 Se(Cl)CH 3 .Theoretical calculations, at the B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,p)//B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory, show that at 298 K the value of Δ r H o for the formation of the adduct is -111.4kJ mol -1 .This value may be compared to -97.0 kJ mol -1 , the value calculated for Δ r H o for the formation of the analogous sulphur adduct, CH 3 S(Cl)CH 3 , following the reaction between Cl atoms and dimethyl sulphide.Variational RRKM theory was used to predict the thermal decomposition rates of the two adducts back to starting materials.The estimated rate constant for the decomposition of the selenium adduct to the reactants is 5 × 10 -5 s -1 , compared to 0.02 s -1 in the case of the sulphur adduct.However, our calculations suggest that the CH 3 Se(Cl)CH 3 adduct, which initially is formed highly excited, will not be stabilised under atmospheric conditions, but rather that it will decompose to yield CH 3 SeCl and CH 3 , a process that is calculated to be exothermic with respect to the initial reactants by 5.8 kJ mol -1 .The formation of CH 3 SCl and CH 3 from the sulphur adduct, on the other hand, is endothermic by 20.8 kJ mol -1 with respect to the initial reactants, and is thus not expected to occur.",2024-04-22,2024,https://doi.org/10.1039/1463-9084/1999,2267,4,1.0,[],,False

"International Consensus Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms and Acute Leukemias: integrating morphologic, clinical, and genomic data","Abstract The classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias was last updated in 2016 within a collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO), the Society for Hematopathology, and the European Association for Haematopathology. This collaboration was primarily based on input from a clinical advisory committees (CACs) composed of pathologists, hematologists, oncologists, geneticists, and bioinformaticians from around the world. The recent advances in our understanding of the biology of hematologic malignancies, the experience with the use of the 2016 WHO classification in clinical practice, and the results of clinical trials have indicated the need for further revising and updating the classification. As a continuation of this CAC-based process, the authors, a group with expertise in the clinical, pathologic, and genetic aspects of these disorders, developed the International Consensus Classification (ICC) of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias. Using a multiparameter approach, the main objective of the consensus process was the definition of real disease entities, including the introduction of new entities and refined criteria for existing diagnostic categories, based on accumulated data.

2022 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures,"Abstract This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on family caregivers, the dementia workforce and society. The Special Report discusses consumers' and primary care physicians' perspectives on awareness, diagnosis and treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), including MCI due to Alzheimer's disease. An estimated 6.5 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, the latest year for which data are available. Alzheimer's disease was officially listed as the sixth‐leading cause of death in the United States in 2019 and the seventh‐leading cause of death in 2020 and 2021, when COVID‐19 entered the ranks of the top ten causes of death. Alzheimer's remains the fifth‐leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145%. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 16 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2021. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $271.6 billion in 2021. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers’ increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes — costs that have been aggravated by COVID‐19. Members of the dementia care workforce have also been affected by COVID‐19. As essential care workers, some have opted to change jobs to protect their own health and the health of their families. However, this occurs at a time when more members of the dementia care workforce are needed. Average per‐person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are almost three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 22 times as great. Total payments in 2022 for health care, long‐term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $321 billion. A recent survey commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association revealed several barriers to consumers’ understanding of MCI. The survey showed low awareness of MCI among Americans, a reluctance among Americans to see their doctor after noticing MCI symptoms, and persistent challenges for primary care physicians in diagnosing MCI. Survey results indicate the need to improve MCI awareness and diagnosis, especially in underserved communities, and to encourage greater participation in MCI‐related clinical trials.",2022-03-14,2022,https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.12638,2258,1,0.6674175219760351,[],,False
Integrated Sensing and Communications: Toward Dual-Functional Wireless Networks for 6G and Beyond,"As the standardization of 5G solidifies, researchers are speculating what 6G will be. The integration of sensing functionality is emerging as a key feature of the 6G Radio Access Network (RAN), allowing for the exploitation of dense cell infrastructures to construct a perceptive network. In this IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC) Special Issue overview, we provide a comprehensive review on the background, range of key applications and state-of-the-art approaches of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC). We commence by discussing the interplay between sensing and communications (S&C) from a historical point of view, and then consider the multiple facets of ISAC and the resulting performance gains. By introducing both ongoing and potential use cases, we shed light on the industrial progress and standardization activities related to ISAC. We analyze a number of performance tradeoffs between S&C, spanning from information theoretical limits to physical layer performance tradeoffs, and the cross-layer design tradeoffs. Next, we discuss the signal processing aspects of ISAC, namely ISAC waveform design and receive signal processing. As a step further, we provide our vision on the deeper integration between S&C within the framework of perceptive networks, where the two functionalities are expected to mutually assist each other, i.e., via communication-assisted sensing and sensing-assisted communications. Finally, we identify the potential integration of ISAC with other emerging communication technologies, and their positive impacts on the future of wireless networks.",2022-03-17,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/jsac.2022.3156632,2252,0,0.602470816218667,"['Fan Liu', 'Yuanhao Cui', 'Christos Masouros', 'Jie Xu', 'Tony Xiao Han', 'Yonina C.

Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents,"Contrastive models like CLIP have been shown to learn robust representations of images that capture both semantics and style. To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation.

International Journal of Molecular Medicine,"Growth factors and/or angiogenic factors are supposed to improve wound healing.The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous pretreatment with combinatory proangiogenic factors on wound closure, mechanical properties, vessel density and morphology.Twenty-eight Balb/c mice were divided equally into two groups.A mixture of VEGF (35.0 µg), bFGF (2.5 µg) and PdGF (3.5 µg) was administered subcutaneously 3, 5 and 7 days to 14 mice before full thickness skin punch biopsy wounding, whereas 14 control animals received three injections of 0.2 ml saline solution.Wound sizes were assessed daily and the repaired tissues were harvested 7 days after complete wound closure.Complete closure (≥95% healing of initial wound area) was reached in all proangiogenic pretreated animals on day 10, whereas controls needed 13 days for complete closure.Tensile strengths were nearly twofold higher compared to the controls (p≤0.01).The punch biopsy material revealed 4.2-fold higher vessel densities in the proangiogenic pretreated group.On day 17, the vessel densities in the proangiogenic pretreated wounds were also 3.2-fold higher compared to the untreated controls.No significant differences were seen in the collagen ratio.Pretreatment with proangiogenic factors revealed several significant effects on wound healing: faster time to closure, a higher vessel density and a better functional outcome.These results suggest a beneficial effect of pretreatment with combinatory growth factors in mouse skin wounds without impaired wound healing.This might be exploited in further investigations in diabetic healing as a therapeutic approach for elective surgery.",2025-12-05,2025,https://doi.org/10.3892/ijmm,2249,1,0.21815534762339497,[],,False
Large language models encode clinical knowledge,"Abstract Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but the bar for clinical applications is high. Attempts to assess the clinical knowledge of models typically rely on automated evaluations based on limited benchmarks. Here, to address these limitations, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing medical question answering datasets spanning professional medicine, research and consumer queries and a new dataset of medical questions searched online, HealthSearchQA. We propose a human evaluation framework for model answers along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension, reasoning, possible harm and bias. In addition, we evaluate Pathways Language Model 1 (PaLM, a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM 2 on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA 3 , MedMCQA 4 , PubMedQA 5 and Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) clinical topics 6 ), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical Licensing Exam-style questions), surpassing the prior state of the art by more than 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal limitations of today’s models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLMs for clinical applications.",2023-07-12,2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06291-2,2248,-1,0.45254099958923877,"['Karan Singhal', 'Shekoofeh Azizi', 'Tao Tu', 'S.

The Gene Ontology knowledgebase in 2023,"Abstract The Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase (http://geneontology.org) is a comprehensive resource concerning the functions of genes and gene products (proteins and noncoding RNAs). GO annotations cover genes from organisms across the tree of life as well as viruses, though most gene function knowledge currently derives from experiments carried out in a relatively small number of model organisms. Here, we provide an updated overview of the GO knowledgebase, as well as the efforts of the broad, international consortium of scientists that develops, maintains, and updates the GO knowledgebase. The GO knowledgebase consists of three components: (1) the GO—a computational knowledge structure describing the functional characteristics of genes; (2) GO annotations—evidence-supported statements asserting that a specific gene product has a particular functional characteristic; and (3) GO Causal Activity Models (GO-CAMs)—mechanistic models of molecular “pathways” (GO biological processes) created by linking multiple GO annotations using defined relations. Each of these components is continually expanded, revised, and updated in response to newly published discoveries and receives extensive QA checks, reviews, and user feedback. For each of these components, we provide a description of the current contents, recent developments to keep the knowledgebase up to date with new discoveries, and guidance on how users can best make use of the data that we provide. We conclude with future directions for the project.",2023-03-03,2023,https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyad031,2245,5,0.4836897931779549,"['Suzi Aleksander', 'James P. Balhoff', 'Seth Carbon', 'J.

Semina: Ciências Agrárias,"Abstract: An increase in the carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) in the atmosphere has occurred in recent years, influencing the different biological aspects of herbivorous insects. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of CO2 increase on the biological aspects of Liriomyza sativae Blanchard leafminer in melon plants. For this, two experiments were carried out: (i) to evaluate the effect of melon plants grown in CO2-enriched environments on the immature developmental stages of L. sativae and L. sativae adult longevity, and (ii) to verify the impact of increased CO2 concentration on L. sativae adult survival, feeding punctures, and oviposition. The experiments were carried out in growth chambers maintained in the temperature regime of 20-26-33 °C (simulating the minimum, average, and maximum daily temperature) and under two CO2 concentrations (400 ppm and 770 ppm). The immature stages and the egg-adult period of L. sativae were longer when they developed on plants grown in high CO2 levels (770 ppm), but no difference in adult longevity was observed. The viability of the immature phases was not different between the two CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, there was no difference in the number of eggs and feeding punctures between treatments. Thus, the increase in CO2 concentration prolongs the duration of the immature stages of L. sativae; however, it does not affect their viability. Adult survival, fertility, and feeding punctures were also unmodified by the environment enriched with CO2.

Para isso foram realizados dois experimentos: (i) o primeiro para avaliar o efeito de plantas de meloeiro cultivadas em ambientes enriquecido com CO2 sobre o desenvolvimento dos estágios imaturos e da longevidade dos adultos de L. sativae; e o (ii) segundo para verificar o impacto do aumento da concentração de CO2 sobre a sobrevivência, puncturas de alimentação e oviposição de L. sativae. Os experimentos foram conduzidos em câmaras de crescimento com regime de temperatura de 20-26-33°C (simulando a temperatura mínima, média e máxima diária) e duas concentrações de CO2, 400 e 770 ppm.

"Breast Cancer Statistics, 2022","Abstract This article is the American Cancer Society’s update on female breast cancer statistics in the United States, including population‐based data on incidence, mortality, survival, and mammography screening. Breast cancer incidence rates have risen in most of the past four decades; during the most recent data years (2010–2019), the rate increased by 0.5% annually, largely driven by localized‐stage and hormone receptor‐positive disease. In contrast, breast cancer mortality rates have declined steadily since their peak in 1989, albeit at a slower pace in recent years (1.3% annually from 2011 to 2020) than in the previous decade (1.9% annually from 2002 to 2011). In total, the death rate dropped by 43% during 1989–2020, translating to 460,000 fewer breast cancer deaths during that time. The death rate declined similarly for women of all racial/ethnic groups except American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom the rates were stable. However, despite a lower incidence rate in Black versus White women (127.8 vs. 133.7 per 100,000), the racial disparity in breast cancer mortality remained unwavering, with the death rate 40% higher in Black women overall (27.6 vs. 19.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2016–2020) and two‐fold higher among adult women younger than 50 years (12.1 vs. 6.5 deaths per 100,000). Black women have the lowest 5‐year relative survival of any racial/ethnic group for every molecular subtype and stage of disease (except stage I), with the largest Black–White gaps in absolute terms for hormone receptor‐positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‐negative disease (88% vs. 96%), hormone receptor‐negative/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‐positive disease (78% vs. 86%), and stage III disease (64% vs. 77%). Progress against breast cancer mortality could be accelerated by mitigating racial disparities through increased access to high‐quality screening and treatment via nationwide Medicaid expansion and partnerships between community stakeholders, advocacy organizations, and health systems.",2022-10-03,2022,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21754,2226,3,0.2547744191681596,"['Angela N.

"The Chemistry of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Revisited: Outlining Their Role in Biological Macromolecules (DNA, Lipids and Proteins) and Induced Pathologies","Living species are continuously subjected to all extrinsic forms of reactive oxidants and others that are produced endogenously. There is extensive literature on the generation and effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in biological processes, both in terms of alteration and their role in cellular signaling and regulatory pathways. Cells produce ROS as a controlled physiological process, but increasing ROS becomes pathological and leads to oxidative stress and disease. The induction of oxidative stress is an imbalance between the production of radical species and the antioxidant defense systems, which can cause damage to cellular biomolecules, including lipids, proteins and DNA. Cellular and biochemical experiments have been complemented in various ways to explain the biological chemistry of ROS oxidants. However, it is often unclear how this translates into chemical reactions involving redox changes. This review addresses this question and includes a robust mechanistic explanation of the chemical reactions of ROS and oxidative stress.",2021-04-28,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22094642,2199,3,0.6018733243693967,"['Celia Andrés', 'José Manuel Pérez de la Lastra', 'Francisco J.

"Agriculture Development, Pesticide Application and Its Impact on the Environment","Pesticides are indispensable in agricultural production. They have been used by farmers to control weeds and insects, and their remarkable increases in agricultural products have been reported. The increase in the world’s population in the 20th century could not have been possible without a parallel increase in food production. About one-third of agricultural products are produced depending on the application of pesticides. Without the use of pesticides, there would be a 78% loss of fruit production, a 54% loss of vegetable production, and a 32% loss of cereal production. Therefore, pesticides play a critical role in reducing diseases and increasing crop yields worldwide. Thus, it is essential to discuss the agricultural development process; the historical perspective, types and specific uses of pesticides; and pesticide behavior, its contamination, and adverse effects on the natural environment. The review study indicates that agricultural development has a long history in many places around the world. The history of pesticide use can be divided into three periods of time. Pesticides are classified by different classification terms such as chemical classes, functional groups, modes of action, and toxicity. Pesticides are used to kill pests and control weeds using chemical ingredients; hence, they can also be toxic to other organisms, including birds, fish, beneficial insects, and non-target plants, as well as air, water, soil, and crops. Moreover, pesticide contamination moves away from the target plants, resulting in environmental pollution. Such chemical residues impact human health through environmental and food contamination. In addition, climate change-related factors also impact on pesticide application and result in increased pesticide usage and pesticide pollution. Therefore, this review will provide the scientific information necessary for pesticide application and management in the future.",2021-01-27,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031112,2193,-1,0.2798363404371115,"['Muyesaier Tudi', 'Huada Daniel Ruan', 'Li Wang', 'Jia Lyu', 'Ross Sadler', 'Des Connell', 'Cordia Chu', 'Dung Phung']",,True
Lutetium-177–PSMA-617 for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer remains fatal despite recent advances. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Lutetium-177 ((177)Lu)–PSMA-617 is a radioligand therapy that delivers beta-particle radiation to PSMA-expressing cells and the surrounding microenvironment. METHODS: We conducted an international, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluating (177)Lu-PSMA-617 in patients who had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with at least one androgen-receptor–pathway inhibitor and one or two taxane regimens and who had PSMA-positive gallium-68 ((68)Ga)–labeled PSMA-11 positron-emission tomographic–computed tomographic scans. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either (177)Lu-PSMA-617 (7.4 GBq every 6 weeks for four to six cycles) plus protocol-permitted standard care or standard care alone. Protocol-permitted standard care excluded chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radium-223 ((223)Ra), and investigational drugs. The alternate primary end points were imaging-based progression-free survival and overall survival, which were powered for hazard ratios of 0.67 and 0.73, respectively. Key secondary end points were objective response, disease control, and time to symptomatic skeletal events. Adverse events during treatment were those occurring no more than 30 days after the last dose and before subsequent anticancer treatment. RESULTS: From June 2018 to mid-October 2019, a total of 831 of 1179 screened patients underwent randomization. The baseline characteristics of the patients were balanced between the groups. The median follow-up was 20.9 months. (177)Lu-PSMA-617 plus standard care significantly prolonged, as compared with standard care, both imaging-based progression-free survival (median, 8.7 vs. 3.4 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.40; 99.2% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.57; P<0.001) and overall survival (median, 15.3 vs. 11.3 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.74; P<0.001). All the key secondary end points significantly favored (177)Lu-PSMA-617. The incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or above was higher with (177)Lu-PSMA-617 than without (52.7% vs. 38.0%), but quality of life was not adversely affected. CONCLUSIONS: Radioligand therapy with (177)Lu-PSMA-617 prolonged imaging-based progression-free survival and overall survival when added to standard care in patients with advanced PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

New Zealand Journal of Ecology,"Tree fern trunks provide establishment surfaces and habitat for a range of plant taxa including many understorey shrubs and canopy trees.The importance of these habitats for augmenting forest biodiversity and woody plant regeneration processes has been the subject of conjecture but has not been robustly assessed.We undertook a latitudinal study of the woody epiphytes and hemiepiphytes of two species of tree ferns (Cyathea smithii, Dicksonia squarrosa) at seven sites throughout New Zealand to determine (1) compositional variation with survey area, host identity, and tree fern size, and (2) the frequency of woody epiphyte and hemiepiphyte occurrence, in particular that of mature individuals.We recorded 3441 individuals of 61 species of woody epiphyte and hemiepiphyte on 700 tree ferns across the seven survey areas.All were facultative or accidental, with many species only ever recorded as seedlings.Epiphyte composition varied latitudinally in response to regional species pools; only two species occurred as woody epiphytes at every survey area: Coprosma grandifolia and Schefflera digitata.Five woody epiphyte species exhibited an apparent host preference to one of the two tree fern species surveyed, and trunk diameter and height were strong predictors of woody epiphyte and hemiepiphyte richness and diversity.Woody epiphytes and hemiepiphytes occurred on 59.7 ± 18.9% of tree ferns surveyed; yet mature epiphytes occurred on only 1.0 ± 0.6% of tree ferns.With the notable exception of some tree fern-Weinmannia communities, our data indicate that tree fern trunks are potentially not important as regeneration sites for most woody understorey and canopy species in New Zealand, instead acting more as sink habitats.",2022-02-13,2022,https://doi.org/10.20417/nzjecol,2168,2,0.5341165272650328,"['James M.

Variational Inference: A Review for Statisticians,"One of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this article, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find a member of that family which is close to the target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback–Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood.

Life’s Essential 8: Updating and Enhancing the American Heart Association’s Construct of Cardiovascular Health: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association,"In 2010, the American Heart Association defined a novel construct of cardiovascular health to promote a paradigm shift from a focus solely on disease treatment to one inclusive of positive health promotion and preservation across the life course in populations and individuals. Extensive subsequent evidence has provided insights into strengths and limitations of the original approach to defining and quantifying cardiovascular health. In response, the American Heart Association convened a writing group to recommend enhancements and updates. The definition and quantification of each of the original metrics (Life’s Simple 7) were evaluated for responsiveness to interindividual variation and intraindividual change. New metrics were considered, and the age spectrum was expanded to include the entire life course. The foundational contexts of social determinants of health and psychological health were addressed as crucial factors in optimizing and preserving cardiovascular health. This presidential advisory introduces an enhanced approach to assessing cardiovascular health: Life’s Essential 8. The components of Life’s Essential 8 include diet (updated), physical activity, nicotine exposure (updated), sleep health (new), body mass index, blood lipids (updated), blood glucose (updated), and blood pressure. Each metric has a new scoring algorithm ranging from 0 to 100 points, allowing generation of a new composite cardiovascular health score (the unweighted average of all components) that also varies from 0 to 100 points. Methods for implementing cardiovascular health assessment and longitudinal monitoring are discussed, as are potential data sources and tools to promote widespread adoption in policy, public health, clinical, institutional, and community settings.",2022-06-29,2022,https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000001078,2132,1,0.4642211751974752,"['Donald M.

Understanding the role of digital technologies in education: A review,"One of the fundamental components of the United Nations’ sustainable development 2030 agenda is quality education. It aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all. Digital technologies have emerged as an essential tool to achieve this goal. These technologies are simple to detect emissions sources, prevent additional damage through improved energy efficiency and lower-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels, and even remove surplus greenhouse gases from the environment. Digital technologies strive to decrease or eliminate pollution and waste while increasing production and efficiency. These technologies have shown a powerful impact on the education system. The recent COVID-19 Pandemic has further institutionalised the applications of digital technologies in education. These digital technologies have made a paradigm shift in the entire education system. It is not only a knowledge provider but also a co-creator of information, a mentor, and an assessor. Technological improvements in education have made life easier for students. Instead of using pen and paper, students nowadays use various software and tools to create presentations and projects. When compared to a stack of notebooks, an iPad is relatively light. When opposed to a weighty book, surfing an E-book is easier. These methods aid in increasing interest in research.

PaLM: Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways,"Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model PaLM. We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.",2022-04-05,2022,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2204.02311,2113,0,0.4984860533258415,"['Aakanksha Chowdhery', 'Sharan Narang', 'Jacob Devlin', 'Maarten Bosma', 'Gaurav Mishra', 'Adam Roberts', 'Paul Barham', 'Hyung Won Chung', 'Charles Sutton', 'Sebastian Gehrmann', 'Parker Schuh', 'Kensen Shi', 'Sasha Tsvyashchenko', 'Joshua Maynez', 'Abhishek S.

<scp>2021</scp> Alzheimer's disease facts and figures,"Abstract This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report discusses the challenges of providing equitable health care for people with dementia in the United States. An estimated 6.2 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth‐leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth‐leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145%. This trajectory of deaths from AD was likely exacerbated in 2020 by the COVID‐19 pandemic. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 15.3 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2020. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $256.7 billion in 2020. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers’ increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes — costs that have been aggravated by COVID‐19. Average per‐person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2021 for health care, long‐term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $355 billion. Despite years of efforts to make health care more equitable in the United States, racial and ethnic disparities remain — both in terms of health disparities, which involve differences in the burden of illness, and health care disparities, which involve differences in the ability to use health care services. Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans continue to have a higher burden of illness and lower access to health care compared with Whites. Such disparities, which have become more apparent during COVID‐19, extend to dementia care. Surveys commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association recently shed new light on the role of discrimination in dementia care, the varying levels of trust between racial and ethnic groups in medical research, and the differences between groups in their levels of concern about and awareness of Alzheimer's disease. These findings emphasize the need to increase racial and ethnic diversity in both the dementia care workforce and in Alzheimer's clinical trials.",2021-03-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.12328,2104,1,0.7155858951294843,"['In the past', None, 'Adult Disease', 'they are said to have', ""another part of the Alzheimer's disease continuum.""]",,False

"Reactive astrocyte nomenclature, definitions, and future directions","Reactive astrocytes are astrocytes undergoing morphological, molecular, and functional remodeling in response to injury, disease, or infection of the CNS. Although this remodeling was first described over a century ago, uncertainties and controversies remain regarding the contribution of reactive astrocytes to CNS diseases, repair, and aging. It is also unclear whether fixed categories of reactive astrocytes exist and, if so, how to identify them. We point out the shortcomings of binary divisions of reactive astrocytes into good-vs-bad, neurotoxic-vs-neuroprotective or A1-vs-A2. We advocate, instead, that research on reactive astrocytes include assessment of multiple molecular and functional parameters-preferably in vivo-plus multivariate statistics and determination of impact on pathological hallmarks in relevant models. These guidelines may spur the discovery of astrocyte-based biomarkers as well as astrocyte-targeting therapies that abrogate detrimental actions of reactive astrocytes, potentiate their neuro- and glioprotective actions, and restore or augment their homeostatic, modulatory, and defensive functions.",2021-02-15,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00783-4,2102,3,0.4083880468321948,"['Carole Escartin', 'Elena Galea', 'András Lakatos', 'James P.

Photorealistic Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Deep Language Understanding,"We present Imagen, a text-to-image diffusion model with an unprecedented degree of photorealism and a deep level of language understanding. Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image generation. Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample fidelity and image-text alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model. Imagen achieves a new state-of-the-art FID score of 7.27 on the COCO dataset, without ever training on COCO, and human raters find Imagen samples to be on par with the COCO data itself in image-text alignment. To assess text-to-image models in greater depth, we introduce DrawBench, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for text-to-image models. With DrawBench, we compare Imagen with recent methods including VQ-GAN+CLIP, Latent Diffusion Models, and DALL-E 2, and find that human raters prefer Imagen over other models in side-by-side comparisons, both in terms of sample quality and image-text alignment.

Large Multi-Modal Model Cartographic Map Comprehension for Textual Locality Georeferencing,"Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated dataset show impressive results for our approach (∼1 km Average distance error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the experiments in light of an LMM’s ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.

COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Worldwide: A Concise Systematic Review of Vaccine Acceptance Rates,"Utility of vaccine campaigns to control coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is not merely dependent on vaccine efficacy and safety. Vaccine acceptance among the general public and healthcare workers appears to have a decisive role in the successful control of the pandemic. The aim of this review was to provide an up-to-date assessment of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rates worldwide. A systematic search of the peer-reviewed English survey literature indexed in PubMed was done on 25 December 2020. Results from 31 peer-reviewed published studies met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis for the final COVID-19 vaccine acceptance estimates. Survey studies on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found from 33 different countries. Among adults representing the general public, the highest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Ecuador (97.0%), Malaysia (94.3%), Indonesia (93.3%) and China (91.3%). However, the lowest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Kuwait (23.6%), Jordan (28.4%), Italy (53.7), Russia (54.9%), Poland (56.3%), US (56.9%), and France (58.9%). Only eight surveys among healthcare workers (doctors and nurses) were found, with vaccine acceptance rates ranging from 27.7% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 78.1% in Israel. In the majority of survey studies among the general public stratified per country (29/47, 62%), the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination showed a level of ≥70%. Low rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were reported in the Middle East, Russia, Africa and several European countries. This could represent a major problem in the global efforts to control the current COVID-19 pandemic. More studies are recommended to address the scope of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Such studies are particularly needed in the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Middle and South America. Addressing the scope of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in various countries is recommended as an initial step for building trust in COVID-19 vaccination efforts.",2021-02-16,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9020160,2078,1,0.4814098281047166,['Malik Sallam'],,True

Out of which, the chatbot technology has experienced tremendous advancements in recent years, especially with ChatGPT emerging as a notable AI language model. This comprehensive review delves into the background, applications, key challenges, and future directions of ChatGPT. We begin by exploring its origins, development, and underlying technology, before examining its wide-ranging applications across industries such as customer service, healthcare, and education. We also highlight the critical challenges that ChatGPT faces, including ethical concerns, data biases, and safety issues, while discussing potential mitigation strategies. Finally, we envision the future of ChatGPT by exploring areas of further research and development, focusing on its integration with other technologies, improved human-AI interaction, and addressing the digital divide. This review offers valuable insights for researchers, developers, and stakeholders interested in the ever-evolving landscape of AI-driven conversational agents. This study explores the various ways ChatGPT has been revolutionizing scientific research, spanning from data processing and hypothesis generation to collaboration and public outreach. Furthermore, the paper examines the potential challenges and ethical concerns surrounding the use of ChatGPT in research, while highlighting the importance of striking a balance between AI-assisted innovation and human expertise. The paper presents several ethical issues in existing computing domain and how ChatGPT can invoke challenges to such notion. This work also includes some biases and limitations of ChatGPT.

Tokens-to-Token ViT: Training Vision Transformers from Scratch on ImageNet,"Transformers, which are popular for language modeling, have been explored for solving vision tasks recently, e.g., the Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification. The ViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with fixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers to model their global relation for classification. However, ViT achieves inferior performance to CNNs when trained from scratch on a midsize dataset like ImageNet. We find it is because: 1) the simple tokenization of input images fails to model the important local structure such as edges and lines among neighboring pixels, leading to low training sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone design of ViT leads to limited feature richness for fixed computation budgets and limited training samples. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new Tokens-To-Token Vision Transformer (T2T-VTT), which incorporates 1) a layer-wise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively structurize the image to tokens by recursively aggregating neighboring Tokens into one Token (Tokens-to-Token), such that local structure represented by surrounding tokens can be modeled and tokens length can be reduced; 2) an efficient backbone with a deep-narrow structure for vision transformer motivated by CNN architecture design after empirical study. Notably, T2T-ViT reduces the parameter count and MACs of vanilla ViT by half, while achieving more than 3.0% improvement when trained from scratch on ImageNet. It also outperforms ResNets and achieves comparable performance with MobileNets by directly training on ImageNet. For example, T2T-ViT with comparable size to ResNet50 (21.5M parameters) can achieve 83.3% top1 accuracy in image resolution 384x384 on ImageNet. <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">1</sup>",2021-10-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/iccv48922.2021.00060,2067,0,1.0,"[None, 'Yunpeng Chen', 'Tao Wang', 'Weihao Yu', 'Yujun Shi', 'Zihang Jiang', 'Francis E.

On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models,"AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.",2021-08-16,2021,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2108.07258,2061,-1,0.24511617058402121,"['Rishi Bommasani', 'Drew A.

HMDB 5.0: the Human Metabolome Database for 2022,"Abstract The Human Metabolome Database or HMDB (https://hmdb.ca) has been providing comprehensive reference information about human metabolites and their associated biological, physiological and chemical properties since 2007. Over the past 15 years, the HMDB has grown and evolved significantly to meet the needs of the metabolomics community and respond to continuing changes in internet and computing technology. This year's update, HMDB 5.0, brings a number of important improvements and upgrades to the database. These should make the HMDB more useful and more appealing to a larger cross-section of users. In particular, these improvements include: (i) a significant increase in the number of metabolite entries (from 114 100 to 217 920 compounds); (ii) enhancements to the quality and depth of metabolite descriptions; (iii) the addition of new structure, spectral and pathway visualization tools; (iv) the inclusion of many new and much more accurately predicted spectral data sets, including predicted NMR spectra, more accurately predicted MS spectra, predicted retention indices and predicted collision cross section data and (v) enhancements to the HMDB’s search functions to facilitate better compound identification. Many other minor improvements and updates to the content, the interface, and general performance of the HMDB website have also been made.

Multivariable association discovery in population-scale meta-omics studies,"It is challenging to associate features such as human health outcomes, diet, environmental conditions, or other metadata to microbial community measurements, due in part to their quantitative properties. Microbiome multi-omics are typically noisy, sparse (zero-inflated), high-dimensional, extremely non-normal, and often in the form of count or compositional measurements. Here we introduce an optimized combination of novel and established methodology to assess multivariable association of microbial community features with complex metadata in population-scale observational studies. Our approach, MaAsLin 2 (Microbiome Multivariable Associations with Linear Models), uses generalized linear and mixed models to accommodate a wide variety of modern epidemiological studies, including cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, as well as a variety of data types (e.g., counts and relative abundances) with or without covariates and repeated measurements. To construct this method, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of a broad range of scenarios under which straightforward identification of meta-omics associations can be challenging. These simulation studies reveal that MaAsLin 2’s linear model preserves statistical power in the presence of repeated measures and multiple covariates, while accounting for the nuances of meta-omics features and controlling false discovery. We also applied MaAsLin 2 to a microbial multi-omics dataset from the Integrative Human Microbiome (HMP2) project which, in addition to reproducing established results, revealed a unique, integrated landscape of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) across multiple time points and omics profiles.",2021-11-16,2021,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009442,2052,-1,0.036920341356234954,"['Himel Mallick', 'Ali Rahnavard', 'Lauren J.

"STROCSS 2021: Strengthening the reporting of cohort, cross-sectional and case-control studies in surgery","Abstract Introduction Strengthening The Reporting Of Cohort Studies in Surgery (STROCSS) guidelines were developed in 2017 in order to improve the reporting quality of observational studies in surgery and updated in 2019. In order to maintain relevance and continue upholding good reporting quality among observational studies in surgery, we aimed to update STROCSS 2019 guidelines. Methods A STROCSS 2021 steering group was formed to come up with proposals to update STROCSS 2019 guidelines. An expert panel of researchers assessed these proposals and judged whether they should become part of STROCSS 2021 guidelines or not, through a Delphi consensus exercise. Results 42 people (89%) completed the DELPHI survey and hence participated in the development of STROCSS 2021 guidelines. All items received a score between 7 and 9 by greater than 70% of the participants, indicating a high level of agreement among the DELPHI group members with the proposed changes to all the items. Conclusion We present updated STROCSS 2021 guidelines to ensure ongoing good reporting quality among observational studies in surgery.

"GTDB: an ongoing census of bacterial and archaeal diversity through a phylogenetically consistent, rank normalized and complete genome-based taxonomy","Abstract The Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB; https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org) provides a phylogenetically consistent and rank normalized genome-based taxonomy for prokaryotic genomes sourced from the NCBI Assembly database. GTDB R06-RS202 spans 254 090 bacterial and 4316 archaeal genomes, a 270% increase since the introduction of the GTDB in November, 2017. These genomes are organized into 45 555 bacterial and 2339 archaeal species clusters which is a 200% increase since the integration of species clusters into the GTDB in June, 2019. Here, we explore prokaryotic diversity from the perspective of the GTDB and highlight the importance of metagenome-assembled genomes in expanding available genomic representation. We also discuss improvements to the GTDB website which allow tracking of taxonomic changes, easy assessment of genome assembly quality, and identification of genomes assembled from type material or used as species representatives. Methodological updates and policy changes made since the inception of the GTDB are then described along with the procedure used to update species clusters in the GTDB. We conclude with a discussion on the use of average nucleotide identities as a pragmatic approach for delineating prokaryotic species.",2021-09-08,2021,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab776,2048,5,0.5496239644352506,"['Donovan H.

Aggregate Confusion: The Divergence of ESG Ratings,"Abstract This paper investigates the divergence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings based on data from six prominent ESG rating agencies: Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini (KLD), Sustainalytics, Moody’s ESG (Vigeo-Eiris), S&amp;P Global (RobecoSAM), Refinitiv (Asset4), and MSCI. We document the rating divergence and map the different methodologies onto a common taxonomy of categories. Using this taxonomy, we decompose the divergence into contributions of scope, measurement, and weight. Measurement contributes 56% of the divergence, scope 38%, and weight 6%. Further analyzing the reasons for measurement divergence, we detect a rater effect where a rater’s overall view of a firm influences the measurement of specific categories. The results call for greater attention to how the data underlying ESG ratings are generated.",2022-05-23,2022,https://doi.org/10.1093/rof/rfac033,2048,2,1.0,"['Florian Berg', 'Julian F Kölbel', 'Roberto Rigobón']",,True
Understanding deep learning (still) requires rethinking generalization,"Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small gap between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models. We supplement this republication with a new section at the end summarizing recent progresses in the field since the original version of this paper.",2021-02-22,2021,https://doi.org/10.1145/3446776,2043,0,1.0,"['Chiyuan Zhang', 'Samy Bengio', 'Moritz Hardt', 'Benjamin Recht', 'Oriol Vinyals']",,True

EnlightenGAN: Deep Light Enhancement Without Paired Supervision,"Deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable success in image restoration and enhancement, but are they still competitive when there is a lack of paired training data? As one such example, this paper explores the low-light image enhancement problem, where in practice it is extremely challenging to simultaneously take a low-light and a normal-light photo of the same visual scene. We propose a highly effective unsupervised generative adversarial network, dubbed EnlightenGAN, that can be trained without low/normal-light image pairs, yet proves to generalize very well on various real-world test images. Instead of supervising the learning using ground truth data, we propose to regularize the unpaired training using the information extracted from the input itself, and benchmark a series of innovations for the low-light image enhancement problem, including a global-local discriminator structure, a self-regularized perceptual loss fusion, and the attention mechanism. Through extensive experiments, our proposed approach outperforms recent methods under a variety of metrics in terms of visual quality and subjective user study. Thanks to the great flexibility brought by unpaired training, EnlightenGAN is demonstrated to be easily adaptable to enhancing real-world images from various domains.

Omicron escapes the majority of existing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies,"Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant contains 15 mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD). How Omicron evades RBD-targeted neutralizing antibodies requires immediate investigation. Here we use high-throughput yeast display screening 1,2 to determine the profiles of RBD escaping mutations for 247 human anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies and show that the neutralizing antibodies can be classified by unsupervised clustering into six epitope groups (A–F)—a grouping that is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications 3–5 . Various single mutations of Omicron can impair neutralizing antibodies of different epitope groups. Specifically, neutralizing antibodies in groups A–D, the epitopes of which overlap with the ACE2-binding motif, are largely escaped by K417N, G446S, E484A and Q493R. Antibodies in group E (for example, S309) 6 and group F (for example, CR3022) 7 , which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but a subset of neutralizing antibodies are still escaped by G339D, N440K and S371L. Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could also be escaped, owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes. In total, over 85% of the tested neutralizing antibodies were escaped by Omicron. With regard to neutralizing-antibody-based drugs, the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10933, REGN10987, AZD1061, AZD8895 and BRII-196 was greatly undermined by Omicron, whereas VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still functioned at a reduced efficacy. Together, our data suggest that infection with Omicron would result in considerable humoral immune evasion, and that neutralizing antibodies targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region will remain most effective.

We added 298 new profiles to the Unvalidated collection when no orthogonal evidence was found in the literature. All the profiles were clustered to provide familial binding profiles for each taxonomic group. Moreover, we revised the structural classification of DNA binding domains to consider plant-specific TFs. This release introduces word clouds to represent the scientific knowledge associated with each TF. We updated the genome tracks of TFBSs predicted with JASPAR profiles in eight organisms; the human and mouse TFBS predictions can be visualized as native tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser. Finally, we provide a new tool to perform JASPAR TFBS enrichment analysis in user-provided genomic regions.

Interleukin-6 Receptor Antagonists in Critically Ill Patients with Covid-19,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of interleukin-6 receptor antagonists in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is unclear. METHODS: We evaluated tocilizumab and sarilumab in an ongoing international, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial. Adult patients with Covid-19, within 24 hours after starting organ support in the intensive care unit (ICU), were randomly assigned to receive tocilizumab (8 mg per kilogram of body weight), sarilumab (400 mg), or standard care (control). The primary outcome was respiratory and cardiovascular organ support-free days, on an ordinal scale combining in-hospital death (assigned a value of -1) and days free of organ support to day 21. The trial uses a Bayesian statistical model with predefined criteria for superiority, efficacy, equivalence, or futility. An odds ratio greater than 1 represented improved survival, more organ support-free days, or both. RESULTS: Both tocilizumab and sarilumab met the predefined criteria for efficacy. At that time, 353 patients had been assigned to tocilizumab, 48 to sarilumab, and 402 to control. The median number of organ support-free days was 10 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) in the tocilizumab group, 11 (interquartile range, 0 to 16) in the sarilumab group, and 0 (interquartile range, -1 to 15) in the control group. The median adjusted cumulative odds ratios were 1.64 (95% credible interval, 1.25 to 2.14) for tocilizumab and 1.76 (95% credible interval, 1.17 to 2.91) for sarilumab as compared with control, yielding posterior probabilities of superiority to control of more than 99.9% and of 99.5%, respectively. An analysis of 90-day survival showed improved survival in the pooled interleukin-6 receptor antagonist groups, yielding a hazard ratio for the comparison with the control group of 1.61 (95% credible interval, 1.25 to 2.08) and a posterior probability of superiority of more than 99.9%. All secondary analyses supported efficacy of these interleukin-6 receptor antagonists. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with Covid-19 receiving organ support in ICUs, treatment with the interleukin-6 receptor antagonists tocilizumab and sarilumab improved outcomes, including survival.

Gut microbiome and health: mechanistic insights,"The gut microbiota is now considered as one of the key elements contributing to the regulation of host health. Virtually all our body sites are colonised by microbes suggesting different types of crosstalk with our organs. Because of the development of molecular tools and techniques (ie, metagenomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, metatranscriptomic), the complex interactions occurring between the host and the different microorganisms are progressively being deciphered. Nowadays, gut microbiota deviations are linked with many diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, intestinal bowel diseases (IBDs) and several types of cancer. Thus, suggesting that various pathways involved in immunity, energy, lipid and glucose metabolism are affected. In this review, specific attention is given to provide a critical evaluation of the current understanding in this field. Numerous molecular mechanisms explaining how gut bacteria might be causally linked with the protection or the onset of diseases are discussed. We examine well-established metabolites (ie, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, trimethylamine N-oxide) and extend this to more recently identified molecular actors (ie, endocannabinoids, bioactive lipids, phenolic-derived compounds, advanced glycation end products and enterosynes) and their specific receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and gamma (PPARγ), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and G protein-coupled receptors (ie, GPR41, GPR43, GPR119, Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5).

Donanemab in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease,"Importance There are limited efficacious treatments for Alzheimer disease. Objective To assess efficacy and adverse events of donanemab, an antibody designed to clear brain amyloid plaque. Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter (277 medical research centers/hospitals in 8 countries), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month phase 3 trial that enrolled 1736 participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease (mild cognitive impairment/mild dementia) with amyloid and low/medium or high tau pathology based on positron emission tomography imaging from June 2020 to November 2021 (last patient visit for primary outcome in April 2023). Interventions Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive donanemab (n = 860) or placebo (n = 876) intravenously every 4 weeks for 72 weeks. Participants in the donanemab group were switched to receive placebo in a blinded manner if dose completion criteria were met. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was change in integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) score from baseline to 76 weeks (range, 0-144; lower scores indicate greater impairment). There were 24 gated outcomes (primary, secondary, and exploratory), including the secondary outcome of change in the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR-SB) score (range, 0-18; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Statistical testing allocated α of .04 to testing low/medium tau population outcomes, with the remainder (.01) for combined population outcomes. Results Among 1736 randomized participants (mean age, 73.0 years; 996 [57.4%] women; 1182 [68.1%] with low/medium tau pathology and 552 [31.8%] with high tau pathology), 1320 (76%) completed the trial. Of the 24 gated outcomes, 23 were statistically significant. The least-squares mean (LSM) change in iADRS score at 76 weeks was −6.02 (95% CI, −7.01 to −5.03) in the donanemab group and −9.27 (95% CI, −10.23 to −8.31) in the placebo group (difference, 3.25 [95% CI, 1.88-4.62]; P &amp;amp;lt; .001) in the low/medium tau population and −10.2 (95% CI, −11.22 to −9.16) with donanemab and −13.1 (95% CI, −14.10 to −12.13) with placebo (difference, 2.92 [95% CI, 1.51-4.33]; P &amp;amp;lt; .001) in the combined population. LSM change in CDR-SB score at 76 weeks was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.00-1.41) with donanemab and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.68-2.08) with placebo (difference, −0.67 [95% CI, −0.95 to −0.40]; P &amp;amp;lt; .001) in the low/medium tau population and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.53-1.91) with donanemab and 2.42 (95% CI, 2.24-2.60) with placebo (difference, −0.7 [95% CI, −0.95 to −0.45]; P &amp;amp;lt; .001) in the combined population. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities of edema or effusion occurred in 205 participants (24.0%; 52 symptomatic) in the donanemab group and 18 (2.1%; 0 symptomatic during study) in the placebo group and infusion-related reactions occurred in 74 participants (8.7%) with donanemab and 4 (0.5%) with placebo. Three deaths in the donanemab group and 1 in the placebo group were considered treatment related. Conclusions and Relevance Among participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and amyloid and tau pathology, donanemab significantly slowed clinical progression at 76 weeks in those with low/medium tau and in the combined low/medium and high tau pathology population.

Russell explains that mathematics can be approached in two distinct directions: one that is driven by a mechanical kind of simplicity and builds towards complexity, from integers to fractions and real numbers to complex ones; and one that searches for abstractness and logical simplicity by asking what general principles underlie mathematics. From here Russell introduces and explains, in his customary pellucid prose, the definition of numbers, finitude, correlation and relation, mathematical limits, infinity, propositional descriptions and classes. Russell concludes with a fascinating summary of the relationship between mathematics and logic, of which he states ""logic is the youth of mathematics.""

"Integrating taxonomic, functional, and strain-level profiling of diverse microbial communities with bioBakery 3","Culture-independent analyses of microbial communities have progressed dramatically in the last decade, particularly due to advances in methods for biological profiling via shotgun metagenomics. Opportunities for improvement continue to accelerate, with greater access to multi-omics, microbial reference genomes, and strain-level diversity. To leverage these, we present bioBakery 3, a set of integrated, improved methods for taxonomic, strain-level, functional, and phylogenetic profiling of metagenomes newly developed to build on the largest set of reference sequences now available. Compared to current alternatives, MetaPhlAn 3 increases the accuracy of taxonomic profiling, and HUMAnN 3 improves that of functional potential and activity. These methods detected novel disease-microbiome links in applications to CRC (1262 metagenomes) and IBD (1635 metagenomes and 817 metatranscriptomes). Strain-level profiling of an additional 4077 metagenomes with StrainPhlAn 3 and PanPhlAn 3 unraveled the phylogenetic and functional structure of the common gut microbe Ruminococcus bromii , previously described by only 15 isolate genomes.

This review focuses on the toxic effect of heavy metals (cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn)) and pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides) adversely influencing the agricultural ecosystem (plant and soil) and human health. Furthermore, heavy metals accumulation and pesticide residues in soils and plants have been discussed in detail. In addition, the characteristics of contaminated soil and plant physiological parameters have been reviewed. Moreover, human diseases caused by exposure to heavy metals and pesticides were also reported. The bioaccumulation, mechanism of action, and transmission pathways of both heavy metals and pesticides are emphasized. In addition, the bioavailability in soil and plant uptake of these contaminants has also been considered.

G*Power is recommended for sample size and power calculations for various statistical methods (F, t, χ2, Z, and exact tests), because it is easy to use and free. The process of sample estimation consists of establishing research goals and hypotheses, choosing appropriate statistical tests, choosing one of 5 possible power analysis methods, inputting the required variables for analysis, and selecting the “calculate” button. The G*Power software supports sample size and power calculation for various statistical methods (F, t, χ2, z, and exact tests). This software is helpful for researchers to estimate the sample size and to conduct power analysis.",2021-07-30,2021,https://doi.org/10.3352/jeehp.2021.18.17,1880,2,1.0,['Hyun Kang'],,True
Principles of Biological Autonomy,"A new, updated edition of the 1979 classic from one of the foremost authors in cognitive science and theoretical biology, with the original text as well as more than 200 citations to current scientific developments. Francisco Varela’s Principles of Biological Autonomy was a groundbreaking text when it was first published in 1979, putting forth a novel theory of how living systems produce and maintain themselves. This new edition, edited and annotated by cognitive scientists Ezequiel Di Paolo and Evan Thompson—revised and complemented with introductory essays for each part of the book—contains a wealth of ideas relevant to current projects in theoretical biology, cognitive science, systems theory, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of biology. Over 220 margin annotations supplement the reading of the text, linking to subsequent research and broader contemporary debates. This foundational book introduces the key concept of autonomy derived as an elaboration of the idea of autopoiesis (the self-production and self-distinction) of living organisms. Varela covers topics in systems theory, neuroscience, theories of perception, and immune networks and offers a participatory epistemology that goes on to be further developed in later enactive literature. These ideas are compelling not only for historical reasons but also because they still illuminate current efforts in developing the enactive approach toward wider and more challenging goals (including language, human cognition, ethics, and environmentalism).",2025-05-13,2025,https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/14875.001.0001,1880,2,0.4183691372963602,['Francisco J.

Fast Kd-Trees for the Kullback-Leibler Divergence and Other Decomposable Bregman Divergences,"The contributions of the paper span theoretical and implementational results. First, we prove that Kd-trees can be extended to ℝ^d with the distance measured by an arbitrary Bregman divergence. Perhaps surprisingly, this shows that the triangle inequality is not necessary for correct pruning in Kd-trees. Second, we offer an efficient algorithm and C++ implementation for nearest neighbour search for decomposable Bregman divergences. The implementation supports the Kullback-Leibler divergence (relative entropy) which is a popular distance between probability vectors and is commonly used in statistics and machine learning. This is a step toward broadening the usage of computational geometry algorithms. Our benchmarks show that our implementation efficiently handles both exact and approximate nearest neighbour queries. Compared to a linear search, we achieve two orders of magnitude speedup for practical scenarios in dimension up to 100. Our solution is simpler and more efficient than competing methods.",2025-01-01,2025,https://doi.org/10.4230/lipics.wads.2025.45,1878,0,1.0,"['Diederik P. Kingma', 'Max Welling']",,True
Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting?,"Recently, there has been a surge of Transformer-based solutions for the long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) task. Despite the growing performance over the past few years, we question the validity of this line of research in this work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably the most successful solution to extract the semantic correlations among the elements in a long sequence. However, in time series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in an ordered set of continuous points. While employing positional encoding and using tokens to embed sub-series in Transformers facilitate preserving some ordering information, the nature of the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss. To validate our claim, we introduce a set of embarrassingly simple one-layer linear models named LTSF-Linear for comparison. Experimental results on nine real-life datasets show that LTSF-Linear surprisingly outperforms existing sophisticated Transformer-based LTSF models in all cases, and often by a large margin. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to explore the impacts of various design elements of LTSF models on their temporal relation extraction capability. We hope this surprising finding opens up new research directions for the LTSF task. We also advocate revisiting the validity of Transformer-based solutions for other time series analysis tasks (e.g., anomaly detection) in the future.",2023-06-26,2023,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i9.26317,1877,-1,0.19647927436110535,"['Ailing Zeng', 'Muxi Chen', 'Lei Zhang', 'Qiang Xu']",,True
Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus: The Titans of Bibliographic Information in Today’s Academic World,"Nowadays, the importance of bibliographic databases (DBs) has increased enormously, as they are the main providers of publication metadata and bibliometric indicators universally used both for research assessment practices and for performing daily tasks. Because the reliability of these tasks firstly depends on the data source, all users of the DBs should be able to choose the most suitable one. Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus are the two main bibliographic DBs. The comprehensive evaluation of the DBs’ coverage is practically impossible without extensive bibliometric analyses or literature reviews, but most DBs users do not have bibliometric competence and/or are not willing to invest additional time for such evaluations. Apart from that, the convenience of the DB’s interface, performance, provided impact indicators and additional tools may also influence the users’ choice. The main goal of this work is to provide all of the potential users with an all-inclusive description of the two main bibliographic DBs by gathering the findings that are presented in the most recent literature and information provided by the owners of the DBs at one place.

Deep Learning for Person Re-Identification: A Survey and Outlook,"Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at retrieving a person of interest across multiple non-overlapping cameras. With the advancement of deep neural networks and increasing demand of intelligent video surveillance, it has gained significantly increased interest in the computer vision community. By dissecting the involved components in developing a person Re-ID system, we categorize it into the closed-world and open-world settings. The widely studied closed-world setting is usually applied under various research-oriented assumptions, and has achieved inspiring success using deep learning techniques on a number of datasets. We first conduct a comprehensive overview with in-depth analysis for closed-world person Re-ID from three different perspectives, including deep feature representation learning, deep metric learning and ranking optimization. With the performance saturation under closed-world setting, the research focus for person Re-ID has recently shifted to the open-world setting, facing more challenging issues. This setting is closer to practical applications under specific scenarios. We summarize the open-world Re-ID in terms of five different aspects. By analyzing the advantages of existing methods, we design a powerful AGW baseline, achieving state-of-the-art or at least comparable performance on twelve datasets for four different Re-ID tasks. Meanwhile, we introduce a new evaluation metric (mINP) for person Re-ID, indicating the cost for finding all the correct matches, which provides an additional criteria to evaluate the Re-ID system for real applications.

TPH-YOLOv5: Improved YOLOv5 Based on Transformer Prediction Head for Object Detection on Drone-captured Scenarios,"Object detection on drone-captured scenarios is a recent popular task. As drones always navigate in different altitudes, the object scale varies violently, which burdens the optimization of networks. Moreover, high-speed and low-altitude flight bring in the motion blur on the densely packed objects, which leads to great challenge of object distinction. To solve the two issues mentioned above, we propose TPH-YOLOv5. Based on YOLOv5, we add one more prediction head to detect different-scale objects. Then we replace the original prediction heads with Transformer Prediction Heads (TPH) to explore the prediction potential with self-attention mechanism. We also integrate convolutional block attention model (CBAM) to find attention region on scenarios with dense objects. To achieve more improvement of our proposed TPH-YOLOv5, we provide bags of useful strategies such as data augmentation, multi-scale testing, multi-model integration and utilizing extra classifier. Extensive experiments on dataset VisDrone2021 show that TPH-YOLOv5 have good performance with impressive interpretability on drone-captured scenarios. On DET-test-challenge dataset, the AP result of TPH-YOLOv5 are 39.18%, which is better than previous SOTA method (DPNetV3) by 1.81%.

In this paper, we give a survey for MTL from the perspective of algorithmic modeling, applications, and theoretical analyses. For algorithmic modeling, we give a definition of MTL and then classify different MTL algorithms into five categories, including feature learning approach, low-rank approach, task clustering approach, task relation learning approach, and decomposition approach as well as discussing the characteristics of each approach. In order to improve the performance of learning tasks further, MTL can be combined with other learning paradigms including semi-supervised learning, active learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, multi-view learning, and graphical models. When the number of tasks is large or the data dimensionality is high, we review online, parallel, and distributed MTL models as well as dimensionality reduction and feature hashing to reveal their computational and storage advantages. Many real-world applications use MTL to boost their performance and we review representative works. Finally, we present theoretical analyses and discuss several future directions for MTL.

At this threshold, we expect a contamination fraction of less than 10%. Of these, 26 candidate events were reported previously in near-real time through gamma-ray coordinates network notices and circulars; 13 are reported here for the first time. The catalog contains events whose sources are black hole binary mergers up to a redshift of approximately 0.8, as well as events whose components cannot be unambiguously identified as black holes or neutron stars. For the latter group, we are unable to determine the nature based on estimates of the component masses and spins from gravitational-wave data alone.

Xlnet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding,"With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.",2025-01-01,2025,https://doi.org/10.57702/mt69o3yg,1856,0,1.0,"['Zhilin Yang', 'Zihang Dai', 'Yiming Yang', 'Jaime Carbonell', 'Ruslan Salakhutdinov', 'Quoc V.

CB-SEM vs PLS-SEM methods for research in social sciences and technology forecasting,"This study compares the two widely used methods of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM): Covariance based Structural Equation Modeling (CB-SEM) and Partial Least Squares based Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The first approach is based on covariance, and the second one is based on variance (partial least squares). It further assesses the difference between PLS and Consistent PLS algorithms. To assess the same, empirical data is used. Four hundred sixty-six respondents from India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the USA, and few other countries are considered. The structural model is tested with the help of both approaches. Findings indicate that the item loadings are usually higher in PLS-SEM than CB-SEM. The structural relationship is closer to CB-SEM if a consistent PLS algorithm is undertaken in PLS-SEM. It is also found that average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability (CR) values are higher in the PLS-SEM method, indicating better construct reliability and validity. CB-SEM is better in providing model fit indices, whereas PLS-SEM fit indices are still evolving. CB-SEM models are better for factor-based models like ours, whereas composite-based models provide excellent outcomes in PLS-SEM. This study contributes to the existing literature significantly by providing an empirical comparison of all the three methods for predictive research domains.

<scp>PANTHER</scp>: Making genome‐scale phylogenetics accessible to all,"Abstract Phylogenetics is a powerful tool for analyzing protein sequences, by inferring their evolutionary relationships to other proteins. However, phylogenetics analyses can be challenging: they are computationally expensive and must be performed carefully in order to avoid systematic errors and artifacts. Protein Analysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER; http://pantherdb.org ) is a publicly available, user‐focused knowledgebase that stores the results of an extensive phylogenetic reconstruction pipeline that includes computational and manual processes and quality control steps. First, fully reconciled phylogenetic trees (including ancestral protein sequences) are reconstructed for a set of “reference” protein sequences obtained from fully sequenced genomes of organisms across the tree of life. Second, the resulting phylogenetic trees are manually reviewed and annotated with function evolution events: inferred gains and losses of protein function along branches of the phylogenetic tree. Here, we describe in detail the current contents of PANTHER, how those contents are generated, and how they can be used in a variety of applications. The PANTHER knowledgebase can be downloaded or accessed via an extensive API. In addition, PANTHER provides software tools to facilitate the application of the knowledgebase to common protein sequence analysis tasks: exploring an annotated genome by gene function; performing “enrichment analysis” of lists of genes; annotating a single sequence or large batch of sequences by homology; and assessing the likelihood that a genetic variant at a particular site in a protein will have deleterious effects.",2021-10-30,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.4218,1851,5,0.49407791234587284,"['Paul D.

Comparing Physician and Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Responses to Patient Questions Posted to a Public Social Media Forum,"Importance The rapid expansion of virtual health care has caused a surge in patient messages concomitant with more work and burnout among health care professionals. Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants could potentially aid in creating answers to patient questions by drafting responses that could be reviewed by clinicians. Objective To evaluate the ability of an AI chatbot assistant (ChatGPT), released in November 2022, to provide quality and empathetic responses to patient questions. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cross-sectional study, a public and nonidentifiable database of questions from a public social media forum (Reddit’s r/AskDocs) was used to randomly draw 195 exchanges from October 2022 where a verified physician responded to a public question. Chatbot responses were generated by entering the original question into a fresh session (without prior questions having been asked in the session) on December 22 and 23, 2022. The original question along with anonymized and randomly ordered physician and chatbot responses were evaluated in triplicate by a team of licensed health care professionals. Evaluators chose “which response was better” and judged both “the quality of information provided” ( very poor , poor , acceptable , good , or very good ) and “the empathy or bedside manner provided” ( not empathetic , slightly empathetic , moderately empathetic , empathetic , and very empathetic ). Mean outcomes were ordered on a 1 to 5 scale and compared between chatbot and physicians. Results Of the 195 questions and responses, evaluators preferred chatbot responses to physician responses in 78.6% (95% CI, 75.0%-81.8%) of the 585 evaluations. Mean (IQR) physician responses were significantly shorter than chatbot responses (52 [17-62] words vs 211 [168-245] words; t = 25.4; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). Chatbot responses were rated of significantly higher quality than physician responses ( t = 13.3; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). The proportion of responses rated as good or very good quality (≥ 4), for instance, was higher for chatbot than physicians (chatbot: 78.5%, 95% CI, 72.3%-84.1%; physicians: 22.1%, 95% CI, 16.4%-28.2%;). This amounted to 3.6 times higher prevalence of good or very good quality responses for the chatbot. Chatbot responses were also rated significantly more empathetic than physician responses ( t = 18.9; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). The proportion of responses rated empathetic or very empathetic (≥4) was higher for chatbot than for physicians (physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%; chatbot: 45.1%, 95% CI, 38.5%-51.8%; physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%). This amounted to 9.8 times higher prevalence of empathetic or very empathetic responses for the chatbot. Conclusions In this cross-sectional study, a chatbot generated quality and empathetic responses to patient questions posed in an online forum. Further exploration of this technology is warranted in clinical settings, such as using chatbot to draft responses that physicians could then edit. Randomized trials could assess further if using AI assistants might improve responses, lower clinician burnout, and improve patient outcomes.",2023-04-28,2023,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.1838,1844,-1,0.43783389281846175,"['John W.

Swin Transformer V2: Scaling Up Capacity and Resolution,"We present techniques for scaling Swin Transformer [35] up to 3 billion parameters and making it capable of training with images of up to 1,536x1,536 resolution.

We tackle issues of training instability, and study how to effectively transfer models pre-trained at low resolutions to higher resolution ones. To this aim, several novel technologies are proposed: 1) a residual post normalization technique and a scaled cosine attention approach to improve the stability of large vision models; 2) a log-spaced continuous position bias technique to effectively transfer models pre-trained at low-resolution images and windows to their higher-resolution counterparts. In addition, we share our crucial implementation details that lead to significant savings of GPU memory consumption and thus make it feasi-ble to train large vision models with regular GPUs.

2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics: A Report of US and Global Data From the American Heart Association,"BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association (AHA), in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, annually reports the most up-to-date statistics related to heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular risk factors, including core health behaviors (smoking, physical activity, nutrition, sleep, and obesity) and health factors (cholesterol, blood pressure, glucose control, and metabolic syndrome) that contribute to cardiovascular health. The AHA Heart Disease and Stroke Statistical Update presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, brain health, complications of pregnancy, kidney disease, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, sudden cardiac arrest, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, valvular disease, venous thromboembolism, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs). METHODS: The AHA, through its Epidemiology and Prevention Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States and globally to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update with review of published literature through the year before writing. The 2024 AHA Statistical Update is the product of a full year’s worth of effort in 2023 by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and AHA staff members. The AHA strives to further understand and help heal health problems inflicted by structural racism, a public health crisis that can significantly damage physical and mental health and perpetuate disparities in access to health care, education, income, housing, and several other factors vital to healthy lives. This year’s edition includes additional global data, as well as data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, with an enhanced focus on health equity across several key domains. RESULTS: Each of the chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics. CONCLUSIONS: The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policymakers, media professionals, clinicians, health care administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions.",2024-01-24,2024,https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000001209,1841,1,0.5004080007354412,"['Seth S.

Pre-Trained Image Processing Transformer,"As the computing power of modern hardware is increasing strongly, pre-trained deep learning models (e.g., BERT, GPT-3) learned on large-scale datasets have shown their effectiveness over conventional methods. The big progress is mainly contributed to the representation ability of transformer and its variant architectures. In this paper, we study the low-level computer vision task (e.g., denoising, super-resolution and deraining) and develop a new pre-trained model, namely, image processing transformer (IPT). To maximally excavate the capability of transformer, we present to utilize the well-known ImageNet benchmark for generating a large amount of corrupted image pairs. The IPT model is trained on these images with multi-heads and multi-tails. In addition, the contrastive learning is introduced for well adapting to different image processing tasks. The pre-trained model can therefore efficiently employed on desired task after fine-tuning.

Rapid epidemic expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in southern Africa,"Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in southern Africa has been characterized by three distinct waves. The first was associated with a mix of SARS-CoV-2 lineages, while the second and third waves were driven by the Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, respectively 1–3 . In November 2021, genomic surveillance teams in South Africa and Botswana detected a new SARS-CoV-2 variant associated with a rapid resurgence of infections in Gauteng province, South Africa. Within three days of the first genome being uploaded, it was designated a variant of concern (Omicron, B.1.1.529) by the World Health Organization and, within three weeks, had been identified in 87 countries. The Omicron variant is exceptional for carrying over 30 mutations in the spike glycoprotein, which are predicted to influence antibody neutralization and spike function 4 .

Reproducible brain-wide association studies require thousands of individuals,"Abstract Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has transformed our understanding of the human brain through well-replicated mapping of abilities to specific structures (for example, lesion studies) and functions 1–3 (for example, task functional MRI (fMRI)). Mental health research and care have yet to realize similar advances from MRI. A primary challenge has been replicating associations between inter-individual differences in brain structure or function and complex cognitive or mental health phenotypes (brain-wide association studies (BWAS)). Such BWAS have typically relied on sample sizes appropriate for classical brain mapping 4 (the median neuroimaging study sample size is about 25), but potentially too small for capturing reproducible brain–behavioural phenotype associations 5,6 . Here we used three of the largest neuroimaging datasets currently available—with a total sample size of around 50,000 individuals—to quantify BWAS effect sizes and reproducibility as a function of sample size. BWAS associations were smaller than previously thought, resulting in statistically underpowered studies, inflated effect sizes and replication failures at typical sample sizes. As sample sizes grew into the thousands, replication rates began to improve and effect size inflation decreased. More robust BWAS effects were detected for functional MRI (versus structural), cognitive tests (versus mental health questionnaires) and multivariate methods (versus univariate). Smaller than expected brain–phenotype associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread BWAS replication failures. In contrast to non-BWAS approaches with larger effects (for example, lesions, interventions and within-person), BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals.",2022-03-16,2022,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04492-9,1809,1,1.0,"['Scott Marek', 'Brenden Tervo‐Clemmens', 'Finnegan J.

"antiSMASH 7.0: new and improved predictions for detection, regulation, chemical structures and visualisation","Abstract Microorganisms produce small bioactive compounds as part of their secondary or specialised metabolism. Often, such metabolites have antimicrobial, anticancer, antifungal, antiviral or other bio-activities and thus play an important role for applications in medicine and agriculture. In the past decade, genome mining has become a widely-used method to explore, access, and analyse the available biodiversity of these compounds. Since 2011, the ‘antibiotics and secondary metabolite analysis shell—antiSMASH’ (https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/) has supported researchers in their microbial genome mining tasks, both as a free to use web server and as a standalone tool under an OSI-approved open source licence. It is currently the most widely used tool for detecting and characterising biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in archaea, bacteria, and fungi.

ProtTrans: Toward Understanding the Language of Life Through Self-Supervised Learning,"Computational biology and bioinformatics provide vast data gold-mines from protein sequences, ideal for Language Models (LMs) taken from Natural Language Processing (NLP). These LMs reach for new prediction frontiers at low inference costs. Here, we trained two auto-regressive models (Transformer-XL, XLNet) and four auto-encoder models (BERT, Albert, Electra, T5) on data from UniRef and BFD containing up to 393 billion amino acids. The protein LMs (pLMs) were trained on the Summit supercomputer using 5616 GPUs and TPU Pod up-to 1024 cores. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the raw pLM-embeddings from unlabeled data captured some biophysical features of protein sequences. We validated the advantage of using the embeddings as exclusive input for several subsequent tasks: (1) a per-residue (per-token) prediction of protein secondary structure (3-state accuracy Q3=81%-87%); (2) per-protein (pooling) predictions of protein sub-cellular location (ten-state accuracy: Q10=81%) and membrane versus water-soluble (2-state accuracy Q2=91%). For secondary structure, the most informative embeddings (ProtT5) for the first time outperformed the state-of-the-art without multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) or evolutionary information thereby bypassing expensive database searches. Taken together, the results implied that pLMs learned some of the grammar of the language of life.

Results depicted that Lapins and Larian gave the lowest (400-450 hours and 94 chill units) chilling requirement. They were followed by Nafrina with 500-550 hours and 120 chill units. Kordia found to be the highest chilling requiring cherry cultivar (700-750 hours and 150 chill units). While, the others were moderate in chilling response. Calculating total growing degree hours, the highest chilling requiring cherry cultivar Kordia needed the least GDH values (14.000 GDH), the others were around 14.00-16.000 GDH. Calculating the hours below 45°F, Pozant (1100 m elevation) gave 3 or 4 times higher chilling accumulation comparing subtropical conditions of Adana (50 m elevation). However, the chill unit values of Adana and Pozanti were quite similar to each other according to the Richardson's chill units (except 2001-2002-winter period). In comparison of cherry cultivars for dormancy breaking initiation of the buds, Kordia, Larian, Nafrina and Sunburst showed an apical dominancy effect and this effect was the strongest in Sunburst whereas the lightest in Summit. Top cut cuttings of these four cherry cultivars broke dormancy earlier in lateral buds than apical buds. Bud breaks rates of apical and lateral buds in Lapins, Summit and 0900 Ziraat were quite similar to each other.",2024-11-19,2024,https://doi.org/10.5829/idosi.mejsr,1800,-1,0.22271383197096456,"['A.B.

"Lipid Nanoparticles─From Liposomes to mRNA Vaccine Delivery, a Landscape of Research Diversity and Advancement","Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged across the pharmaceutical industry as promising vehicles to deliver a variety of therapeutics. Currently in the spotlight as vital components of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, LNPs play a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA to cells. Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals. This report is intended to serve as a useful resource for those interested in LNP nanotechnologies, their applications, and the global research effort for their development.",2021-06-28,2021,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c04996,1799,3,1.0,"['Rumiana Tenchov', 'Robert E.

2023 ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies,"Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence with the aim of assisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or therapeutic approach for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines are intended for use by health professionals and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) makes its Guidelines freely available. ESC Guidelines do not override the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription, and, where appropriate, to respect the ethical rules of their profession. ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated. ESC Policies and Procedures for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines). The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients with this pathology. The selection procedure aimed to include members from across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty Communities. Consideration was given to diversity and inclusion, notably with respect to gender and country of origin. The Task Force performed a critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, including assessment of the risk-benefit ratio. The strength of every recommendation and the level of evidence supporting them were weighed and scored according to predefined scales as outlined below. The Task Force followed ESC voting procedures, and all approved recommendations were subject to a vote and achieved at least 75% agreement among voting members. The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines) and have been compiled in a report published in a supplementary document with the guidelines.

How Does ChatGPT Perform on the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)? The Implications of Large Language Models for Medical Education and Knowledge Assessment,"Background Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a 175-billion-parameter natural language processing model that can generate conversation-style responses to user input. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on questions within the scope of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 exams, as well as to analyze responses for user interpretability. Methods We used 2 sets of multiple-choice questions to evaluate ChatGPT’s performance, each with questions pertaining to Step 1 and Step 2. The first set was derived from AMBOSS, a commonly used question bank for medical students, which also provides statistics on question difficulty and the performance on an exam relative to the user base. The second set was the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) free 120 questions. ChatGPT’s performance was compared to 2 other large language models, GPT-3 and InstructGPT. The text output of each ChatGPT response was evaluated across 3 qualitative metrics: logical justification of the answer selected, presence of information internal to the question, and presence of information external to the question. Results Of the 4 data sets, AMBOSS-Step1, AMBOSS-Step2, NBME-Free-Step1, and NBME-Free-Step2, ChatGPT achieved accuracies of 44% (44/100), 42% (42/100), 64.4% (56/87), and 57.8% (59/102), respectively. ChatGPT outperformed InstructGPT by 8.15% on average across all data sets, and GPT-3 performed similarly to random chance. The model demonstrated a significant decrease in performance as question difficulty increased (P=.01) within the AMBOSS-Step1 data set. We found that logical justification for ChatGPT’s answer selection was present in 100% of outputs of the NBME data sets. Internal information to the question was present in 96.8% (183/189) of all questions. The presence of information external to the question was 44.5% and 27% lower for incorrect answers relative to correct answers on the NBME-Free-Step1 (P&lt;.001) and NBME-Free-Step2 (P=.001) data sets, respectively. Conclusions ChatGPT marks a significant improvement in natural language processing models on the tasks of medical question answering. By performing at a greater than 60% threshold on the NBME-Free-Step-1 data set, we show that the model achieves the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student. Additionally, we highlight ChatGPT’s capacity to provide logic and informational context across the majority of answers. These facts taken together make a compelling case for the potential applications of ChatGPT as an interactive medical education tool to support learning.",2023-02-08,2023,https://doi.org/10.2196/45312,1794,2,0.4498705249536379,"['Aidan Gilson', 'Conrad Safranek', 'Thomas Huang', 'Vimig Socrates', 'Ling Chi', 'Richard A.

Defining Training and Performance Caliber: A Participant Classification Framework,"Throughout the sport-science and sports-medicine literature, the term “elite” subjects might be one of the most overused and ill-defined terms. Currently, there is no common perspective or terminology to characterize the caliber and training status of an individual or cohort. This paper presents a 6-tiered Participant Classification Framework whereby all individuals across a spectrum of exercise backgrounds and athletic abilities can be classified. The Participant Classification Framework uses training volume and performance metrics to classify a participant to one of the following: Tier 0: Sedentary; Tier 1: Recreationally Active; Tier 2: Trained/Developmental; Tier 3: Highly Trained/National Level; Tier 4: Elite/International Level; or Tier 5: World Class. We suggest the Participant Classification Framework can be used to classify participants both prospectively (as part of study participant recruitment) and retrospectively (during systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses). Discussion around how the Participant Classification Framework can be tailored toward different sports, athletes, and/or events has occurred, and sport-specific examples provided. Additional nuances such as depth of sport participation, nationality differences, and gender parity within a sport are all discussed. Finally, chronological age with reference to the junior and masters athlete, as well as the Paralympic athlete, and their inclusion within the Participant Classification Framework has also been considered. It is our intention that this framework be widely implemented to systematically classify participants in research featuring exercise, sport, performance, health, and/or fitness outcomes going forward, providing the much-needed uniformity to classification practices.",2021-12-29,2021,https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2021-0451,1791,-1,0.25391381124682855,"['Alannah K.A McKay', 'TRENT STELLINGWERFF', 'Ella S.

The changing epidemiology of human monkeypox—A potential threat? A systematic review,"Monkeypox, a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopoxvirus, results in a smallpox-like disease in humans. Since monkeypox in humans was initially diagnosed in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), it has spread to other regions of Africa (primarily West and Central), and cases outside Africa have emerged in recent years. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature on how monkeypox epidemiology has evolved, with particular emphasis on the number of confirmed, probable, and/or possible cases, age at presentation, mortality, and geographical spread. The review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020208269). We identified 48 peer-reviewed articles and 18 grey literature sources for data extraction. The number of human monkeypox cases has been on the rise since the 1970s, with the most dramatic increases occurring in the DRC. The median age at presentation has increased from 4 (1970s) to 21 years (2010–2019). There was an overall case fatality rate of 8.7%, with a significant difference between clades—Central African 10.6% (95% CI: 8.4%– 13.3%) vs. West African 3.6% (95% CI: 1.7%– 6.8%). Since 2003, import- and travel-related spread outside of Africa has occasionally resulted in outbreaks. Interactions/activities with infected animals or individuals are risk behaviors associated with acquiring monkeypox. Our review shows an escalation of monkeypox cases, especially in the highly endemic DRC, a spread to other countries, and a growing median age from young children to young adults. These findings may be related to the cessation of smallpox vaccination, which provided some cross-protection against monkeypox, leading to increased human-to-human transmission. The appearance of outbreaks beyond Africa highlights the global relevance of the disease. Increased surveillance and detection of monkeypox cases are essential tools for understanding the continuously changing epidemiology of this resurging disease.",2022-02-11,2022,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010141,1790,1,0.27043413952331313,"['Eveline M.

Factor Analysis as a Tool for Survey Analysis,"Factor analysis is particularly suitable to extract few factors from the large number of related variables to a more manageable number, prior to using them in other analysis such as multiple regression or multivariate analysis of variance. It can be beneficial in developing of a questionnaire. Sometimes adding more statements in the questionnaire fail to give clear understanding of the variables. With the help of factor analysis, irrelevant questions can be removed from the final questionnaire. This study proposed a factor analysis to identify the factors underlying the variables of a questionnaire to measure tourist satisfaction. In this study, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlettâs test of Sphericity are used to assess the factorability of the data. Determinant score is calculated to examine the multicollinearity among the variables. To determine the number of factors to be extracted, Kaiserâs Criterion and Scree test are examined. Varimax orthogonal factor rotation method is applied to minimize the number of variables that have high loadings on each factor. The internal consistency is confirmed by calculating Cronbachâs alpha and composite reliability to test the instrument accuracy. The convergent validity is established when average variance extracted is greater than or equal to 0.5. The results have revealed that the factor analysis not only allows detecting irrelevant items but will also allow extracting the valuable factors from the data set of a questionnaire survey. The application of factor analysis for questionnaire evaluation provides very valuable inputs to the decision makers to focus on few important factors rather than a large number of parameters.",2021-01-20,2021,https://doi.org/10.12691/ajams-9-1-2,1776,2,1.0,['Noora Shrestha'],,True
Face Recognition by Elastic Bunch Graph Matching*†,"We present a system for recognizing human faces from single images out of a large database containing one image per person. Faces are represented by labeled graphs, based on a Gabor wavelet transform. Image graphs of new faces are extracted by an elastic graph matching process and can be compared by a simple similarity function. The system differs from the preceding one [1] in three respects. Phase information is used for accurate node positioning. Object-adapted graphs are used to handle large rotations in depth.

Emerging S‐Scheme Photocatalyst,"Abstract Photocatalysis is a green technology to use ubiquitous and intermittent sunlight. The emerging S‐scheme heterojunction has demonstrated its superiority in photocatalysis. This article covers the state‐of‐the‐art progress and provides new insights into its general designing criteria. It starts with the challenges confronted by single photocatalyst from the perspective of energy dissipation by borrowing the common behaviors in the dye molecule. Subsequently, other problems faced by single photocatalyst are summarized. Then a viable solution for these problems is the construction of heterojunctions. To overcome the problems and mistakes of type‐II and Z‐scheme heterojunctions, S‐scheme heterojunction is proposed and the underlying reaction mechanism is summarized. Afterward, the design principles for S‐scheme heterojunction are proposed and four types of S‐scheme heterojunctions are suggested. Following this, direct characterization techniques for testifying the charge transfer in S‐scheme heterojunction are presented. Finally, different photocatalytic applications of S‐scheme heterojunctions are summarized. Specifically, this work endeavors to clarify the critical understanding on curved Fermi level in S‐scheme heterojunction interface, which can help strengthen and advance the fundamental theories of photocatalysis. Moreover, the current challenges and prospects of the S‐scheme heterojunction photocatalyst are critically discussed.",2021-12-28,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202107668,1769,4,0.2855820404392799,"['Liuyang Zhang', 'Jianjun Zhang', 'Huogen Yu', 'Jiaguo Yu']",,False

TYGS and LPSN: a database tandem for fast and reliable genome-based classification and nomenclature of prokaryotes,"Abstract Microbial systematics is heavily influenced by genome-based methods and challenged by an ever increasing number of taxon names and associated sequences in public data repositories. This poses a challenge for database systems, particularly since it is obviously advantageous if such data are based on a globally recognized approach to manage names, such as the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes. The amount of data can only be handled if accurate and reliable high-throughput platforms are available that are able to both comply with this demand and to keep track of all changes in an efficient and flexible way. The List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) is an expert-curated authoritative resource for prokaryotic nomenclature and is available at https://lpsn.dsmz.de. The Type (Strain) Genome Server (TYGS) is a high-throughput platform for accurate genome-based taxonomy and is available at https://tygs.dsmz.de.

A Comprehensive Measurement of the Local Value of the Hubble Constant with 1 km s<sup>−1</sup> Mpc<sup>−1</sup> Uncertainty from the Hubble Space Telescope and the SH0ES Team,"Abstract We report observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of Cepheid variables in the host galaxies of 42 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) used to calibrate the Hubble constant ( H 0 ). These include the complete sample of all suitable SNe Ia discovered in the last four decades at redshift z ≤ 0.01, collected and calibrated from ≥1000 HST orbits, more than doubling the sample whose size limits the precision of the direct determination of H 0 . The Cepheids are calibrated geometrically from Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, masers in NGC 4258 (here tripling that sample of Cepheids), and detached eclipsing binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud. All Cepheids in these anchors and SN Ia hosts were measured with the same instrument (WFC3) and filters ( F555W , F814W , F160W ) to negate zero-point errors. We present multiple verifications of Cepheid photometry and six tests of background determinations that show Cepheid measurements are accurate in the presence of crowded backgrounds. The SNe Ia in these hosts calibrate the magnitude–redshift relation from the revised Pantheon+ compilation, accounting here for covariance between all SN data and with host properties and SN surveys matched throughout to negate systematics. We decrease the uncertainty in the local determination of H 0 to 1 km s −1 Mpc −1 including systematics. We present results for a comprehensive set of nearly 70 analysis variants to explore the sensitivity of H 0 to selections of anchors, SN surveys, redshift ranges, the treatment of Cepheid dust, metallicity, form of the period–luminosity relation, SN color, peculiar-velocity corrections, sample bifurcations, and simultaneous measurement of the expansion history. Our baseline result from the Cepheid–SN Ia sample is H 0 = 73.04 ± 1.04 km s −1 Mpc −1 , which includes systematic uncertainties and lies near the median of all analysis variants. We demonstrate consistency with measures from HST of the TRGB between SN Ia hosts and NGC 4258, and include them simultaneously to yield 72.53 ± 0.99 km s −1 Mpc −1 . The inclusion of high-redshift SNe Ia yields H 0 = 73.30 ± 1.04 km s −1 Mpc −1 and q 0 = −0.51 ± 0.024. We find a 5 σ difference with the prediction of H 0 from Planck cosmic microwave background observations under ΛCDM, with no indication that the discrepancy arises from measurement uncertainties or analysis variations considered to date. The source of this now long-standing discrepancy between direct and cosmological routes to determining H 0 remains unknown.",2022-07-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/ac5c5b,1764,6,0.8929370258962418,"['Adam G.

AASLD Practice Guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"PREAMBLE The study of NAFLD has intensified significantly, with more than 1400 publications since 2018, when the last American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Guidance document was published.1 This new AASLD Guidance document reflects many advances in the field pertinent to any practitioner caring for patients with NAFLD and emphasizes advances in noninvasive risk stratification and therapeutics. A separate guideline focused on the management of patients with NAFLD in the context of diabetes has been written jointly by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and AASLD.2 Given the significant growth in pediatric NAFLD, it will not be covered here to allow for a more robust discussion of the diagnosis and management of pediatric NAFLD in the upcoming AASLD Pediatric NAFLD Guidance. A ""Guidance"" differs from a ""Guideline"" in that it is not bound by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment Development and Evaluation system. Thus, actionable statements rather than formal recommendations are provided herein. The highest available level of evidence was used to develop these statements, and, where high-level evidence was not available, expert opinion was used to develop guidance statements to inform clinical practice. Key points highlight important concepts relevant to understanding the disease and its management. The most profound advances in NAFLD relevant to clinical practice are in biomarkers and therapeutics. Biomarkers and noninvasive tests (NITs) can be used clinically to either exclude advanced diseases or identify those with a high probability of cirrhosis.3,4 NIT ""cut points"" vary with the populations studied, underlying disease severity, and clinical setting. Those proposed in this guidance are meant to aid decision-making in the clinic and are not meant to be interpreted in isolation. Identifying patients with ""at-risk"" NASH (biopsy-proven NASH with stage 2 or higher fibrosis) is a more recent area of interest. Although the definitive diagnosis and staging of NASH remain linked to histology, noninvasive tools can now be used to assess the likelihood of significant fibrosis, predict risk of disease progression and decompensation, make management decisions, and, to some degree, assess response to treatment. There is an ongoing debate over the nomenclature of fatty liver disease, which had not been finalized at the time this guidance was published. At the culmination of a rigorous consensus process, it is intended that any formal change in nomenclature will advance the field without a negative impact on disease awareness, clinical trial endpoints, or the drug development/approval process. Furthermore, it should allow for the emergence of newly recognized disease subtypes to address the impact of disease heterogeneity, including the role of alcohol, on disease progression and response to therapy. Input from patients has been central to all stages of the consensus process to ensure the minimization of nomenclature-related stigma. DEFINITIONS NAFLD is an overarching term that includes all disease grades and stages and refers to a population in which ≥5% of hepatocytes display macrovesicular steatosis in the absence of a readily identified alternative cause of steatosis (eg, medications, starvation, monogenic disorders) in individuals who drink little or no alcohol (defined as < 20 g/d for women and <30 g/d for men). The spectrum of disease includes NAFL, characterized by macrovesicular hepatic steatosis that may be accompanied by mild inflammation, and NASH, which is additionally characterized by the presence of inflammation and cellular injury (ballooning), with or without fibrosis, and finally cirrhosis, which is characterized by bands of fibrous septa leading to the formation of cirrhotic nodules, in which the earlier features of NASH may no longer be fully appreciated on a liver biopsy. UPDATE ON EPIDEMIOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY The prevalence of NAFLD and NASH is rising worldwide in parallel with increases in the prevalence of obesity and metabolic comorbid disease (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, central obesity, and hypertension).5,6 The prevalence of NAFLD in adults is estimated to be 25%–30% in the general population7–9 and varies with the clinical setting, race/ethnicity, and geographic region studied but often remains undiagnosed.10–14 The associated economic burden attributable to NASH is substantial.15–17 The prevalence of NASH in the general population is challenging to determine with certainty; however, NASH was identified in 14% of asymptomatic patients undergoing colon cancer screening.14 This study also highlights that since the publication of a prior prospective prevalence study,18 the prevalence of clinically significant fibrosis (stage 2 or higher fibrosis) has increased >2-fold. This is supported by the projected rise in NAFLD prevalence by 2030, when patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis, defined as bridging fibrosis (F3) or compensated cirrhosis (F4), will increase disproportionately, mirroring the projected doubling of NASH.5,19 As such, the incidence of hepatic decompensation, HCC, and death related to NASH cirrhosis are likewise expected to increase 2- to 3-fold by 2030.5 Although expected to increase further, NASH-related cirrhosis is already the leading indication for liver transplantation in women and those >65 years of age and is on par with alcohol as the leading indication overall.20–22 Natural history of disease progression Data from meta-analyses and pooled studies demonstrate that fibrosis and the presence of steatohepatitis are the primary predictors of disease progression.23–25 The collinearity between NASH and the fibrosis it induces makes it challenging to demonstrate the independent contribution of NASH to fibrosis and adverse outcomes in multivariable analyses.26,27 Although fibrosis is the primary determinant of adverse outcomes, increased liver-related morbidity and mortality and nonhepatic malignancy are observed in patients with NAFLD even in the absence of fibrosis on initial biopsy.25 Nevertheless, patients with NASH and at least stage 2 fibrosis (F2), referred to as ""at-risk"" NASH, have a demonstrably higher risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality.24,28 Fibrosis progression is influenced by many factors such as the presence and severity of comorbid disease, genomic profile, and environmental factors. A meta-analysis of placebo-treated patients in 35 NASH trials found minimal progression, suggesting that nonpharmacologic factors (frequent visits/monitoring, dietary or lifestyle counseling, or changes) may reduce progression.29 An earlier meta-analysis of cohorts with longitudinal paired biopsies30 demonstrated a NAFLD fibrosis progression rate of one stage per 7 years in those with NASH versus 14 years for those with NAFL.30 The diagnosis of cirrhosis, determined by biopsy or noninvasively, is important because it changes clinical management. Those with cirrhosis require biannual screening for HCC as well as screening for varices and monitoring for signs or symptoms of decompensation.31,32 Among patients with cirrhosis, progression to clinical decompensation ranges from 3% to 20% per year.12,33–35 Association between disease stage and adverse outcomes The most common causes of death in patients with NAFLD overall are cardiovascular disease (CVD) and nonhepatic malignancy, followed by liver disease. The amount of liver fibrosis identified histologically in patients with NAFLD has been strongly linked to the development of liver-related outcomes and death.24,26,36,37 Bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis are associated with an exponentially greater risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality than earlier stages of fibrosis.23,24,35 In a prospective study of 1773 patients, all-cause mortality in those with fibrosis stages 0–2 was 0.32 per 100 person-years, compared with 0.89 per 100 person-years in those with bridging fibrosis and 1.76 per 100 person-years in those with cirrhosis. After correcting for multiple factors, hepatic decompensation was associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 6.8; 95% CI, 2.2–21.3).35 Cirrhosis regression has been associated with a 6-fold reduction in liver-related events in clinical trials.38Key points: Patients with NASH and F2–4 fibrosis are at higher risk for liver-related events and mortality and are considered to have ""at-risk"" NASH. The rates of fibrosis progression and hepatic decompensation vary depending on baseline disease severity, genetic, individual environmental, and comorbid disease determinants. CVD and nonhepatic malignancies are the most common causes of mortality in patients with NAFLD without advanced fibrosis; death from liver disease predominates in patients with advanced fibrosis. MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR PATHOGENESIS The presence and severity of NAFL and NASH are substantially determined by factors that govern the supply and disposition of fatty acids, diacylglycerols, ceramides, cholesterol, phospholipids, and other intrahepatic lipids. Energy oversupply and limited adipose tissue expansion contribute to insulin resistance and metabolic disease.39 When energy intake exceeds metabolic needs and disposal capacity, carbohydrates, in the form of dietary sugars (eg, fructose, sucrose, and glucose), drive the formation and accumulation of intrahepatic fat from de novo lipogenesis (DNL).40,41 There is substantial interindividual heterogeneity in the role of DNL among patients with NAFLD.42,43 In addition, the type of fat consumed plays a role in the development of NASH, with a higher risk associated with saturated versus unsaturated fat consumption (Figure 1).44–46FIGURE 1: Pathogenic drivers of NAFLD as therapeutic targets. Overview of the major mechanisms that lead to the phenotype of NASH and its consequences, many of which can be leveraged therapeutically. Not shown are the many areas where genetic polymorphisms may play a role and where important modifying factors such as cholesterol, types of dietary fats consumed [saturated vs. polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)], the gut microbiome, uric acid, and periodic hypoxia (sleep apnea) may also influence these pathways. A primary disease driver may be an oversupply of fat to adipocytes such that their ability to store triglyceride without inducing cell stress is exceeded, which activates inflammatory pathways and causes insulin resistance. Understanding the major drivers of NASH facilitates the rational development of therapies for patients with NASH. Specific sites of intervention that might prevent or resolve NASH include interventions that modulate food intake (eg, portion sizes, bariatric surgery, satiety regulators), increase energy disposal (eg, exercise, thermogenesis), improve adipocyte insulin sensitivity [eg, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ ligands], impair de novo lipogenesis (eg, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and fatty acid synthase inhibitors), increase hepatic oxidative metabolism (PPARα ligands and thyroid hormone receptor beta agonists), and attenuate inflammation, cell death, and fibrogenesis. Therapeutic agents affecting multiple metabolic pathways throughout the body with potential beneficial effects on the liver include peptide hormone analogs (eg, analogs of fibroblast growth factor-19, fibroblast growth factor-21, glucagon-like peptide-1, gastric inhibitory peptide, glucagon) and nuclear receptor ligands such as drugs that target PPARα, PPARδ, PPARγ, thyroid hormone receptor β, and farnesoid X receptor. Abbreviations: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CVD, cardiovascular disease.Insulin resistance is nearly universal in patients with NAFLD and is present in the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle.47 Adipose tissue insulin resistance is characterized by increased release of free fatty acids from adipocytes (lipolysis) in the fasting state48 and worsens with the progression of NAFLD to NASH.39,47,49 Important factors that govern energy disposal include the frequency and intensity of exercise, the activation of brown adipose tissue to an energy-consuming thermogenic phenotype, and counterregulatory mechanisms that diminish energy disposal in response to reductions in calorie intake.39,50 The ability and desire to engage in regular exercise can be strongly influenced by personal, community, corporate, societal, and legislative decisions, all of which thus have roles in the development of NASH. The heterogeneity of factors contributing to the pathophysiology of NASH among patients has impeded the development of diagnostic tests and therapeutics.51 Although in some patients, the development and progression of NASH are driven by substrate overload and insulin resistance, in other patients, disease progression is heavily influenced by genetic factors impacting hepatocyte lipid handling.43 Genetic polymorphisms have been associated with more advanced liver disease and the development of HCC in NASH. The I148M polymorphism of PNPLA3 impairs lipolysis of triglyceride in lipid droplets,52 and polymorphisms in other proteins that play a role in hepatocyte fat metabolism have also been linked to the prevalence and severity of NAFLD, including transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2), which may play a role in cholesterol metabolism,53 and MBOAT7, which influences phospholipid metabolism.54 Recently, loss-of-function variants in HSD17B13, a gene that encodes an enzyme that also localizes to lipid droplets in hepatocytes, have been linked to protection against NASH, progressive fibrosis, and HCC.55 Rare loss-of-function mutations in CIDEB, a protein needed for activation of DNL,56 have also been shown to be protective.57 A host of additional factors, the review of which is beyond the scope of this guidance, contribute to heterogeneity in disease activity and progression.49,58–63 Additional factors such as hepatocyte uric acid production, exposure to products derived from the gut microbiome, and perhaps low hepatic magnesium levels, may also contribute to the NASH phenotype.64–69 Transcriptomic profiling of large cohorts of patients is further contributing to our understanding of this disease heterogeneity and its progression.70,71 The response of the liver to lipotoxic injury includes activation and recruitment of resident macrophages, which further contributes to hepatocellular injury and stellate cell activation as part of a complex interplay among hepatic cell types.60,72,73 Although markers of oxidative stress have been a consistent finding in NASH, its role in the pathogenesis of NASH in humans remains uncertain.74Key points: Fundamental elements of NASH pathogenesis include an imbalance between nutrient delivery to the liver and their utilization and disposal coupled with adipose tissue dysfunction. Interindividual differences in genetic, dietary, behavioral, and environmental factors influence disease course. Systemic inflammation, particularly stemming from dysfunctional adipose tissue, contributes to disease progression. Insulin resistance contributes to the development of NAFLD and promotes disease progression. COMORBID CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH NAFLD NAFLD is closely linked to and often precedes the development of metabolic abnormalities (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, central obesity, and hypertension).47,61,75–77 Having several metabolic abnormalities confers an even greater risk of histological progression of NASH and all-cause mortality.8,47,78–81 The association between NAFLD and metabolic comorbidities may also reflect bidirectional interactions between the liver and other endocrine organs (eg, pancreas, adipose tissue, muscle) through the secretion of hepatokines that regulate fatty acid metabolism, insulin action, and glucose metabolism,82–88 adipokines, and myokines.39,89,90 Obesity The presence and severity of obesity are associated with NAFLD and disease progression.91–93 Body fat distribution is an important determinant of the contributory role of obesity in NAFLD (Table 1). Android body fat distribution, characterized by increased truncal subcutaneous fat and visceral fat confers a higher risk of insulin resistance, CVD, and hepatic fibrosis, irrespective of body mass index (BMI).94–99 In contrast, gynoid body fat distribution, characterized by increased subcutaneous body fat predominantly in the hips or buttocks, appears to be protective against NAFLD.39,100 Visceral fat, which is more metabolically active and inflammatory than subcutaneous fat, mediates the majority of this risk.101–105 As adipose tissue becomes more metabolically stressed, dysfunctional, and inflamed, insulin signaling is progressively impaired, promoting the inappropriate release of fatty acids leading to intrahepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation.47,106,107 TABLE 1 - Initial evaluation of a patient with NAFLD History Weight history; medical comorbidities; recent and current medications; family history of T2DM, NAFLD, or cirrhosis; screening for OSA; alcohol use, including amount, pattern of use, and duration Physical examination Body fat distribution (eg, android vs. gynoid, lipodystrophic), features of insulin resistance (eg, dorsal-cervical fat pad, acanthosis nigricans), features of advanced liver disease (eg, firm liver, splenomegaly, prominent abdominal veins, ascites, gynecomastia, spider angiomata, palmar erythema) Laboratory tests Hepatic panel, CBC with platelets, fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (A1c), fasting lipid profile, creatinine and urine microalbumin or protein to creatinine ratio, hepatitis C if not previously screened.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) T2DM is the most impactful risk factor for the development of NAFLD, fibrosis progression, and HCC.108–111 Given the central pathogenic role that insulin resistance plays in the pathogenesis of both T2DM and NAFLD, it is not surprising that patients with T2DM have a higher prevalence of NAFLD (ranging from 30% to 75%)10,112,113 and a higher risk of developing NASH with fibrosis.93,114–117 Furthermore, the probability of advanced fibrosis increases with the duration of T2DM. Although there is potential for lead time and length time biases, these studies underscore the strong relationship between T2DM and NAFLD. The relationship between NAFLD and T2DM is bidirectional in epidemiological studies. Early in its course, NAFLD is associated with a reduction in insulin sensitivity,47 even in the absence of overt diabetes. The presence of NAFLD is associated with a 2- to 5-fold risk of incident diabetes,75,118–121 and therefore, patients with NAFLD should be screened for the presence of T2DM (Table 1). Furthermore, as liver disease progresses, so does insulin resistance and beta cell failure, making diabetes more challenging to manage.107 The role of glycemic control in the progression of NAFLD/NASH remains controversial, with 2 small studies showing an association between poor glycemic control and hepatocellular injury and liver fibrosis,68,122 whereas other studies have not corroborated this finding.116,117,123 Although NAFLD has also been described in patients with type 1 diabetes, its prevalence is much lower than in T2DM, and it is closely related to coexistent metabolic risk factors (eg, higher BMI).124,125 Hypertension Hypertension is commonly associated with NAFLD. There is a higher incidence of hypertension in those with NAFLD across the disease spectrum, with incidence rates of 6.5 per 100 person-years in early disease to 14.5 per 100 person-years in those with cirrhosis.35 The presence of hypertension is clearly additive to other metabolic comorbidities with respect to the epidemiological risk of NASH126,127 and has been associated with fibrosis progression.30 Whether hypertension mechanistically promotes the development of NAFLD/NASH or the inverse, or both are manifestations of underlying metabolic disease drivers, has not been established.128,129 Dyslipidemia Patients with NAFLD are twice as likely to exhibit plasma lipid abnormalities as those without NAFLD,120 and the serum lipid subfractions are more atherogenic in patients with NAFLD.130,131 NASH resolution can lead to improved plasma cholesterol and triglyceride and impact it is to this is driven by the of the therapeutic As patients to cirrhosis, to remain at high risk for the of serum and to hepatic of in NAFLD should include the of to as on lipid risk and CVD risk therapies of with other such as acid, fatty acids, or should be considered when with a does not therapeutic are in patients with NAFLD across the disease spectrum, including advanced liver disease, and lead to a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and in clinical are often even among patients with are also considered in the context of compensated cirrhosis and may have beneficial effects on decompensation and HCC additional are Although have been used in patients with cirrhosis, the risk of adverse events might be higher in this and thus more is In patients with cirrhosis and high CVD risk undergoing evaluation for liver can be considered with In patients with NAFLD and elevated (eg, or a of with fatty acids or should be used to reduce the risk of may also improve CVD outcomes when triglyceride are and are In is as an to to reduce CVD can be considered for of glycemic control to its on lipid should be when are used in with to a higher risk of sleep is associated with and several studies is also associated with more advanced NAFLD/NASH a of OSA, has been linked to of glucose and lipid insulin and increased hepatic Given the strong association between NAFLD and OSA, patients with NAFLD who are or should be screened for OSA, and or other sleep studies should be considered for those at high CVD CVD is an important cause of death in patients with however, the to which NAFLD CVD is A strong association between NAFLD and disease, failure, and particularly metabolism, increased presence and of and mechanisms the between NAFLD and Furthermore, in a large studied the incidence of events was the across all fibrosis however, the of events was the management of CVD risk factors with the of CVD morbidity and mortality is to outcomes in patients with comorbid such as dyslipidemia, and and promoting is to CVD in those at disease A meta-analysis of 20 studies found that NAFLD was associated with a increased prevalence of NAFLD and NASH are also associated with from the NASH demonstrate a higher prevalence of in patients with advanced fibrosis compared with lower fibrosis The to which the liver mechanistically contributes to the development of independent of associated metabolic disease remains to be are and for CVD risk reduction in patients with NAFLD across the disease spectrum, including compensated cirrhosis. on the and of in patients with cirrhosis, with monitoring be considered in patients with high CVD can be through lifestyle changes and with fatty acids, or Patients with diabetes are at higher risk for NASH and advanced fibrosis and should be screened for advanced fibrosis.

KOBAS-i: intelligent prioritization and exploratory visualization of biological functions for gene enrichment analysis,"Abstract Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis plays an essential role in extracting biological insight from genome-scale experiments. ORA (overrepresentation analysis), FCS (functional class scoring), and PT (pathway topology) approaches are three generations of GSE methods along the timeline of development. Previous versions of KOBAS provided services based on just the ORA method. Here we presented version 3.0 of KOBAS, which is named KOBAS-i (short for KOBAS intelligent version). It introduced a novel machine learning-based method we published earlier, CGPS, which incorporates seven FCS tools and two PT tools into a single ensemble score and intelligently prioritizes the relevant biological pathways. In addition, KOBAS has expanded the downstream exploratory visualization for selecting and understanding the enriched results. The tool constructs a novel view of cirFunMap, which presents different enriched terms and their correlations in a landscape. Finally, based on the previous version's framework, KOBAS increased the number of supported species from 1327 to 5944. For an easier local run, it also provides a prebuilt Docker image that requires no installation, as a supplementary to the source code version.

An oral SARS-CoV-2 M <sup>pro</sup> inhibitor clinical candidate for the treatment of COVID-19,"Path to another drug against COVID-19 The rapid development of vaccines has been crucial in battling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, access challenges remain, breakthrough infections occur, and emerging variants present increased risk. Developing antiviral therapeutics is therefore a high priority for the treatment of COVID-19. Some drug candidates in clinical trials act against the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, but there are other viral enzymes that have been considered good targets for inhibition by drugs. Owen et al . report the discovery and characterization of a drug against the main protease involved in the cleavage of polyproteins involved in viral replication. The drug, PF-07321332, can be administered orally, has good selectivity and safety profiles, and protects against infection in a mouse model. In a phase 1 clinical trial, the drug reached concentrations expected to inhibit the virus based on in vitro studies. It also inhibited other coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and could be in the armory against future viral threats. —VV",2021-11-02,2021,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abl4784,1754,-1,0.1786449159009203,"['Dafydd R.

A Study to Evaluate Psychological Distress and Self-Esteem Among Patients with Hemodialysis,"Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive disease that affects more than 800 million people worldwide, representing more than 10% of the global population. It is more common in older people, women, and racial minorities, as well as in people with diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure. CKD has become one of the top causes of mortality worldwide, and is one of the few non-communicable diseases that have seen an increase in related deaths over the last few decades. The high number of affected people and the serious negative consequences of chronic disease should lead to increased efforts to improve prevention and treatment efforts. Around the world, there are an estimated 1,800-1,600 extra deaths per 10000 patients who are on dialysis.  Aim: The aim of the study is to determine the psychological distress and self-esteem among dialysis patients.  Research Methodology: A quantitative cross-sectional investigate plan was utilized to conduct a research study among 30 dialysis patients. Convenient sampling techniques were utilized to collect data from standardized tool using questionnaire techniques.  Result: Study showed that 36.7% of the samples were doing well, 23.3% had mild psychological distress, 23.3% of the samples had moderate psychological distress and severe distress is seen in 16.7% of the samples. 73.3% of them had normal self-esteem, 20% of the study population had low self-esteem and 6.7% had above average self-esteem.

A Survey on Evaluation of Large Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry, owing to their unprecedented performance in various applications. As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks. Over the past years, significant efforts have been made to examine LLMs from various perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions: what to evaluate , where to evaluate , and how to evaluate . Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the ‘where’ and ‘how’ questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing the performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges that lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable insights to researchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the development of more proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should be treated as an essential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at: https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/LLM-eval-survey",2024-01-23,2024,https://doi.org/10.1145/3641289,1741,-1,0.2019288729763683,"['Yupeng Chang', 'Xu Wang', 'Jindong Wang', 'Yuan Wu', 'Linyi Yang', 'Kaijie Zhu', 'Hao Chen', 'Xiaoyuan Yi', 'Cunxiang Wang', 'Yidong Wang', 'Wei Ye', 'Yue Zhang', 'Yi Chang', 'Philip S.

The term ‘postbiotics’ is increasingly found in the scientific literature and on commercial products, yet is inconsistently used and lacks a clear definition. The purpose of this panel was to consider the scientific, commercial and regulatory parameters encompassing this emerging term, propose a useful definition and thereby establish a foundation for future developments. The panel defined a postbiotic as a “preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host”. Effective postbiotics must contain inactivated microbial cells or cell components, with or without metabolites, that contribute to observed health benefits. The panel also discussed existing evidence of health-promoting effects of postbiotics, potential mechanisms of action, levels of evidence required to meet the stated definition, safety and implications for stakeholders. The panel determined that a definition of postbiotics is useful so that scientists, clinical triallists, industry, regulators and consumers have common ground for future activity in this area. A generally accepted definition will hopefully lead to regulatory clarity and promote innovation and the development of new postbiotic products.",2021-05-04,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-021-00440-6,1740,1,0.1268932283956586,"['Seppo Salminen', 'María Carmen Collado', 'Akihito Endo', 'Colin Hill', 'Sarah Lebeer', 'Eamonn M.M.

Domain-Specific Language Model Pretraining for Biomedical Natural Language Processing,"Pretraining large neural language models, such as BERT, has led to impressive gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, most pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web. A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. In this article, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP benchmark from publicly available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition. To help accelerate research in biomedical NLP, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our BLURB benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding &amp; Reasoning Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/BLURB .",2021-10-15,2021,https://doi.org/10.1145/3458754,1737,0,1.0,"['裕二 池谷', 'Robert Tinn', 'Hao Cheng', 'Michael Lucas', 'Naoto Usuyama', 'Xiaodong Liu', 'Tristan Naumann', 'Jianfeng Gao', 'Hoifung Poon']",,True
Giving an Account of Oneself,"What does it mean to lead a moral life?In her first extended study of moral philosophy, Judith Butler offers a provocative outline for a new ethical practice-one responsive to the need for critical autonomy and grounded in a new sense of the human subject.Butler takes as her starting point one's ability to answer the questions What have I done?and What ought I to do?She shows that these question can be answered only by asking a prior question, Who is this 'I' who is under an obligation to give an account of itself and to act in certain ways?Because I find that I cannot give an account of myself without accounting for the social conditions under which I emerge, ethical reflection requires a turn to social theory.In three powerfully crafted and lucidly written chapters, Butler demonstrates how difficult it is to give an account of oneself, and how this lack of self-transparency and narratibility is crucial to an ethical understanding of the human. In brilliant dialogue with Adorno, Levinas, Foucault, and other thinkers, she eloquently argues the limits, possibilities, and dangers of contemporary ethical thought.Butler offers a critique of the moral self, arguing that the transparent, rational, and continuous ethical subject is an impossible construct that seeks to deny the specificity of what it is to be human. We can know ourselves only incompletely, and only in relation to a broader social world that has always preceded us and already shaped us in ways we cannot grasp. If inevitably we are partially opaque to ourselves, how can giving an account of ourselves define the ethical act? And doesn't an ethical system that holds us impossibly accountable for full self-knowledge and self-consistency inflict a kind of psychic violence, leading to a culture of self-beratement and cruelty? How does the turn to social theory offer us a chance to understand the specifically social character of our own unknowingness about ourselves?In this invaluable book, by recasting ethics as a project in which being ethical means becoming critical of norms under which we are asked to act, but which we can never fully choose, Butler illuminates what it means for us as fallible creaturesto create and share an ethics of vulnerability, humility, and ethical responsiveness.

Nonmonetary Effects of the Financial Crisis in the Propagation of the Great Depression,"This paper examines the effects of the financial crisis of the 1930s onthe path of aggregate output during that period. Our approach is complementary to that of Friedman and Schwartz, who emphasized the monetary impact of the bank failures; we focus on non-monetary (primarily credit-related) aspects of the financial sector--output link and consider the problems of debtors as well as those of the banking system. We argue that the financial disruptions of 1930-33 reduced the efficiency of the credit allocation process; and that the resulting higher cost and reduced availability of credit acted to depress aggregate demand. Evidence suggests that effects of this type can help explain the unusual length and depth of the Great Depression.",2024-01-09,2024,https://doi.org/10.2307/jj.4908259.6,1733,-1,0.4187932535794088,[],,False
Uformer: A General U-Shaped Transformer for Image Restoration,"In this paper, we present Uformer, an effective and efficient Transformer-based architecture for image restoration, in which we build a hierarchical encoder-decoder network using the Transformer block. In Uformer, there are two core designs. First, we introduce a novel locally-enhanced window (LeWin) Transformer block, which performs non-overlapping window-based self-attention instead of global self-attention. It significantly reduces the computational complexity on high resolution feature map while capturing local context. Second, we propose a learnable multi-scale restoration modulator in the form of a multi-scale spatial bias to adjust features in multiple layers of the Uformer decoder. Our modulator demonstrates superior capability for restoring details for various image restoration tasks while introducing marginal extra parameters and computational cost. Powered by these two designs, Uformer enjoys a high capability for capturing both local and global dependencies for image restoration. To evaluate our approach, extensive experiments are conducted on several image restoration tasks, including image denoising, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring and deraining. Without bells and whistles, our Uformer achieves superior or comparable performance compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

We have now updated this estimate using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuriaes, and Risk Factors Study 2019. We find that pollution remains responsible for approximately 9 million deaths per year, corresponding to one in six deaths worldwide. Reductions have occurred in the number of deaths attributable to the types of pollution associated with extreme poverty. However, these reductions in deaths from household air pollution and water pollution are offset by increased deaths attributable to ambient air pollution and toxic chemical pollution (ie, lead). Deaths from these modern pollution risk factors, which are the unintended consequence of industrialisation and urbanisation, have risen by 7% since 2015 and by over 66% since 2000. Despite ongoing efforts by UN agencies, committed groups, committed individuals, and some national governments (mostly in high-income countries), little real progress against pollution can be identified overall, particularly in the low-income and middle-income countries, where pollution is most severe. Urgent attention is needed to control pollution and prevent pollution-related disease, with an emphasis on air pollution and lead poisoning, and a stronger focus on hazardous chemical pollution. Pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss are closely linked. Successful control of these conjoined threats requires a globally supported, formal science-policy interface to inform intervention, influence research, and guide funding. Pollution has typically been viewed as a local issue to be addressed through subnational and national regulation or, occasionally, using regional policy in higher-income countries. Now, however, it is increasingly clear that pollution is a planetary threat, and that its drivers, its dispersion, and its effects on health transcend local boundaries and demand a global response. Global action on all major modern pollutants is needed. Global efforts can synergise with other global environmental policy programmes, especially as a large-scale, rapid transition away from all fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy is an effective strategy for preventing pollution while also slowing down climate change, and thus achieves a double benefit for planetary health.",2022-05-17,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2542-5196(22)00090-0,1720,2,0.510041326295533,"['Richard Fuller', 'Philip J.

South African Journal of Education,"I analyse the efforts of one learner, Devan, and a student teacher, Sumaiya Desai, in whose class he participated, as she attempted to realise what may be referred to as a social, cultural, political approach to the school mathematics curriculum through the practice of project work. The focus is specifically on the actions and reflections of Devan as he participated in the project work experience and overturned his casting as a &amp;quot;failing &amp;quot; mathematics learner in a Grade 6 mathematics classroom. I theorise the practice of project work through the data related to Devan and the conceptual tools of project work: problem-orientation; participant-directed; inter-disciplinarity; and exemplarity, and use this framework to organise the structure of this paper. Through this conceptual framing, the challenges and possibilities that such classrooms pose, for learners like Devan but also for the theoretical ideas and associated practice, are made visible and I discuss the potentiality that remained unexplored.

PLIP 2021: expanding the scope of the protein–ligand interaction profiler to DNA and RNA,"Abstract With the growth of protein structure data, the analysis of molecular interactions between ligands and their target molecules is gaining importance. PLIP, the protein–ligand interaction profiler, detects and visualises these interactions and provides data in formats suitable for further processing. PLIP has proven very successful in applications ranging from the characterisation of docking experiments to the assessment of novel ligand–protein complexes. Besides ligand–protein interactions, interactions with DNA and RNA play a vital role in many applications, such as drugs targeting DNA or RNA-binding proteins. To date, over 7% of all 3D structures in the Protein Data Bank include DNA or RNA. Therefore, we extended PLIP to encompass these important molecules. We demonstrate the power of this extension with examples of a cancer drug binding to a DNA target, and an RNA–protein complex central to a neurological disease.

A Review on Biosensors and Recent Development of Nanostructured Materials-Enabled Biosensors,"A biosensor is an integrated receptor-transducer device, which can convert a biological response into an electrical signal. The design and development of biosensors have taken a center stage for researchers or scientists in the recent decade owing to the wide range of biosensor applications, such as health care and disease diagnosis, environmental monitoring, water and food quality monitoring, and drug delivery. The main challenges involved in the biosensor progress are (i) the efficient capturing of biorecognition signals and the transformation of these signals into electrochemical, electrical, optical, gravimetric, or acoustic signals (transduction process), (ii) enhancing transducer performance i.e., increasing sensitivity, shorter response time, reproducibility, and low detection limits even to detect individual molecules, and (iii) miniaturization of the biosensing devices using micro-and nano-fabrication technologies. Those challenges can be met through the integration of sensing technology with nanomaterials, which range from zero- to three-dimensional, possessing a high surface-to-volume ratio, good conductivities, shock-bearing abilities, and color tunability. Nanomaterials (NMs) employed in the fabrication and nanobiosensors include nanoparticles (NPs) (high stability and high carrier capacity), nanowires (NWs) and nanorods (NRs) (capable of high detection sensitivity), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (large surface area, high electrical and thermal conductivity), and quantum dots (QDs) (color tunability). Furthermore, these nanomaterials can themselves act as transduction elements. This review summarizes the evolution of biosensors, the types of biosensors based on their receptors, transducers, and modern approaches employed in biosensors using nanomaterials such as NPs (e.g., noble metal NPs and metal oxide NPs), NWs, NRs, CNTs, QDs, and dendrimers and their recent advancement in biosensing technology with the expansion of nanotechnology.",2021-02-05,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21041109,1702,4,1.0,"['V.

Multi-Stage Progressive Image Restoration,"Image restoration tasks demand a complex balance between spatial details and high-level contextualized information while recovering images. In this paper, we propose a novel synergistic design that can optimally balance these competing goals. Our main proposal is a multi-stage architecture, that progressively learns restoration functions for the degraded inputs, thereby breaking down the overall recovery process into more manageable steps. Specifically, our model first learns the contextualized features using encoder-decoder architectures and later combines them with a high-resolution branch that retains local information. At each stage, we introduce a novel per-pixel adaptive design that leverages in-situ supervised attention to reweight the local features. A key ingredient in such a multi-stage architecture is the information exchange between different stages. To this end, we propose a two-faceted approach where the information is not only exchanged sequentially from early to late stages, but lateral connections between feature processing blocks also exist to avoid any loss of information. The resulting tightly interlinked multi-stage architecture, named as MPRNet, delivers strong performance gains on ten datasets across a range of tasks including image deraining, deblurring, and denoising.

CrossViT: Cross-Attention Multi-Scale Vision Transformer for Image Classification,"The recently developed vision transformer (ViT) has achieved promising results on image classification compared to convolutional neural networks. Inspired by this, in this paper, we study how to learn multi-scale feature representations in transformer models for image classification. To this end, we propose a dual-branch transformer to com-bine image patches (i.e., tokens in a transformer) of different sizes to produce stronger image features. Our approach processes small-patch and large-patch tokens with two separate branches of different computational complexity and these tokens are then fused purely by attention multiple times to complement each other. Furthermore, to reduce computation, we develop a simple yet effective token fusion module based on cross attention, which uses a single token for each branch as a query to exchange information with other branches. Our proposed cross-attention only requires linear time for both computational and memory complexity instead of quadratic time otherwise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs better than or on par with several concurrent works on vision transformer, in addition to efficient CNN models. For example, on the ImageNet1K dataset, with some architectural changes, our approach outperforms the recent DeiT by a large margin of 2% with a small to moderate increase in FLOPs and model parameters.

Global burden of colorectal cancer in 2020 and 2040: incidence and mortality estimates from GLOBOCAN,"Objective Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. The geographical and temporal burden of this cancer provides insights into risk factor prevalence and progress in cancer control strategies. We examine the current and future burden of CRC in 185 countries in 2020 and 2040. Methods Data on CRC cases and deaths were extracted from the GLOBOCAN database for the year 2020. Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates were calculated by sex, country, world region and Human Development Index (HDI) for 185 countries. Age-specific rates were also estimated. The predicted number of cases and deaths in 2040 were calculated based on global demographic projections by HDI. Results Over 1.9 million new CRC cases and 930 000 deaths were estimated in 2020. Incidence rates were highest in Australia/ New Zealand and European regions (40.6 per 100 000, males) and lowest in several African regions and Southern Asia (4.4 per 100 000, females). Similar patterns were observed for mortality rates, with the highest observed in Eastern Europe (20.2 per 100 000, males) and the lowest in Southern Asia (2.5 per 100 000, females). The burden of CRC is projected to increase to 3.2 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths by 2040 with most cases predicted to occur in high or very high HDI countries. Conclusions CRC is a highly frequent cancer worldwide, and largely preventable through changes in modifiable risk factors, alongside the detection and removal of precancerous lesions. With increasing rates in transitioning countries and younger adults, there is a pressing need to better understand and act on findings to avert future cases and deaths from the disease.",2022-09-08,2022,https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2022-327736,1691,3,1.0,"['Eileen Morgan', 'Melina Arnold', 'Andrea Gini', 'Valentina Lorenzoni', 'Citadel J.

"Clean and Affordable Hydrogen Fuel from Alkaline Water Splitting: Past, Recent Progress, and Future Prospects","Abstract Hydrogen economy has emerged as a very promising alternative to the current hydrocarbon economy, which involves the process of harvesting renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and then further utilization of clean hydrogen fuel. The production of hydrogen by water electrolysis is an essential prerequisite of the hydrogen economy with zero carbon emission. Among various water electrolysis technologies, alkaline water splitting has been commercialized for more than 100 years, representing the most mature and economic technology. Here, the historic development of water electrolysis is overviewed, and several critical electrochemical parameters are discussed. After that, advanced nonprecious metal electrocatalysts that emerged recently for negotiating the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are discussed, including transition metal oxides, (oxy)hydroxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, and nitrides for the OER, as well as transition metal alloys, chalcogenides, phosphides, and carbides for the HER. In this section, particular attention is paid to the catalyst synthesis, activity and stability challenges, performance improvement, and industry‐relevant developments.

SoilGrids 2.0: producing soil information for the globe with quantified spatial uncertainty,"Abstract. SoilGrids produces maps of soil properties for the entire globe at medium spatial resolution (250 m cell size) using state-of-the-art machine learning methods to generate the necessary models. It takes as inputs soil observations from about 240 000 locations worldwide and over 400 global environmental covariates describing vegetation, terrain morphology, climate, geology and hydrology. The aim of this work was the production of global maps of soil properties, with cross-validation, hyper-parameter selection and quantification of spatially explicit uncertainty, as implemented in the SoilGrids version 2.0 product incorporating state-of-the-art practices and adapting them for global digital soil mapping with legacy data. The paper presents the evaluation of the global predictions produced for soil organic carbon content, total nitrogen, coarse fragments, pH (water), cation exchange capacity, bulk density and texture fractions at six standard depths (up to 200 cm). The quantitative evaluation showed metrics in line with previous global, continental and large-region studies. The qualitative evaluation showed that coarse-scale patterns are well reproduced.

Scientific Machine Learning Through Physics–Informed Neural Networks: Where we are and What’s Next,"Abstract Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are neural networks (NNs) that encode model equations, like Partial Differential Equations (PDE), as a component of the neural network itself. PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must fit observed data while reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.",2022-07-26,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-022-01939-z,1672,-1,0.23225407848377955,"['Salvatore Cuomo', 'Vincenzo Schiano Di Cola', 'Fabio Giampaolo', 'Gianluigi Rozza', 'Maziar Raissi', 'Francesco Piccialli']",,True
In the realm of the Hubble tension—a review of solutions <sup>*</sup>,"Abstract The simplest ΛCDM model provides a good fit to a large span of cosmological data but harbors large areas of phenomenology and ignorance. With the improvement of the number and the accuracy of observations, discrepancies among key cosmological parameters of the model have emerged. The most statistically significant tension is the 4 σ to 6 σ disagreement between predictions of the Hubble constant, H 0 , made by the early time probes in concert with the ‘vanilla’ ΛCDM cosmological model, and a number of late time, model-independent determinations of H 0 from local measurements of distances and redshifts. The high precision and consistency of the data at both ends present strong challenges to the possible solution space and demands a hypothesis with enough rigor to explain multiple observations—whether these invoke new physics, unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors. A thorough review of the problem including a discussion of recent Hubble constant estimates and a summary of the proposed theoretical solutions is presented here. We include more than 1000 references, indicating that the interest in this area has grown considerably just during the last few years. We classify the many proposals to resolve the tension in these categories: early dark energy, late dark energy, dark energy models with 6 degrees of freedom and their extensions, models with extra relativistic degrees of freedom, models with extra interactions, unified cosmologies, modified gravity, inflationary models, modified recombination history, physics of the critical phenomena, and alternative proposals. Some are formally successful, improving the fit to the data in light of their additional degrees of freedom, restoring agreement within 1–2 σ between Planck 2018, using the cosmic microwave background power spectra data, baryon acoustic oscillations, Pantheon SN data, and R20, the latest SH0ES Team Riess, et al (2021 Astrophys. J. 908 L6) measurement of the Hubble constant ( H 0 = 73.2 ± 1.3 km s −1 Mpc −1 at 68% confidence level). However, there are many more unsuccessful models which leave the discrepancy well above the 3 σ disagreement level. In many cases, reduced tension comes not simply from a change in the value of H 0 but also due to an increase in its uncertainty due to degeneracy with additional physics, complicating the picture and pointing to the need for additional probes. While no specific proposal makes a strong case for being highly likely or far better than all others, solutions involving early or dynamical dark energy, neutrino interactions, interacting cosmologies, primordial magnetic fields, and modified gravity provide the best options until a better alternative comes along.",2021-06-04,2021,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6382/ac086d,1670,6,1.0,"['Eleonora Di Valentino', 'OLGA MENA', 'Supriya Pan', 'Luca Visinelli', 'Wei-Qiang Yang', 'Alessandro Melchiorri', 'David F.

Qualitative Data Analysis,Qualitative data analysis is challenging both from a conceptual point of view as well as from the practical techniques required to produce useful results. In fact the problem begins with establishing how data is perceived and what are regarded as the most appropriate sources of data. These issues have to be embedded in any comprehensive understanding of the research question and the researcher needs to clarify for himself or herself their attitude toward a holistic approach such as Hermeneutics relative to a more “fractured” approach such as Content Analysis. In either case the objective of developing theory is of paramount importance to the academic researcher.,2022-05-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1142/9789811256943_0011,1669,2,1.0,[],,False
"Run, Don't Walk: Chasing Higher FLOPS for Faster Neural Networks","To design fast neural networks, many works have been focusing on reducing the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). We observe that such reduction in FLOPs, however, does not necessarily lead to a similar level of re-duction in latency. This mainly stems from inefficiently low floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). To achieve faster networks, we revisit popular operators and demonstrate that such low FLOPS is mainly due to frequent memory access of the operators, especially the depthwise con-volution. We hence propose a novel partial convolution (PConv) that extracts spatial features more efficiently, by cutting down redundant computation and memory access simultaneously. Building upon our PConv, we further propose FasterNet, a new family of neural networks, which attains substantially higher running speed than others on a wide range of devices, without compromising on accuracy for various vision tasks. For example, on ImageNet-lk, our tiny FasterNet-TO is 2.8×, 3.3×, and 2.4× faster than MobileViT-XXS on GPU, CPU, and ARM processors, respectively, while being 2.9% more accurate. Our large FasterNet-L achieves impressive 83.5% top-1 accuracy, on par with the emerging Swin-B, while having 36% higher inference throughput on GPU, as well as saving 37% compute time on CPU.

Insect decline in the Anthropocene: Death by a thousand cuts,"Nature is under siege. In the last 10,000 y the human population has grown from 1 million to 7.8 billion. Much of Earth’s arable lands are already in agriculture (1), millions of acres of tropical forest are cleared each year (2, 3), atmospheric CO2 levels are at their highest concentrations in more than 3 million y (4), and climates are erratically and steadily changing from pole to pole, triggering unprecedented droughts, fires, and floods across continents. Indeed, most biologists agree that the world has entered its sixth mass extinction event, the first since the end of the Cretaceous Period 66 million y ago, when more than 80% of all species, including the nonavian dinosaurs, perished. Ongoing losses have been clearly demonstrated for better-studied groups of organisms. Terrestrial vertebrate population sizes and ranges have contracted by one-third, and many mammals have experienced range declines of at least 80% over the last century (5). A 2019 assessment suggests that half of all amphibians are imperiled (2.5% of which have recently gone extinct) (6). Bird numbers across North America have fallen by 2.9 billion since 1970 (7). Prospects for the world’s coral reefs, beyond the middle of this century, could scarcely be more dire (8). A 2020 United Nations report estimated that more than a million species are in danger of extinction over the next few decades (9), but also see the more bridled assessments in refs. 10 and 11. Although a flurry of reports has drawn attention to declines in insect abundance, biomass, species richness, and range sizes (e.g., refs. 12⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–18; for reviews see refs. 19 and 20), whether the rates of declines for insects are on par with or exceed those for other groups remains unknown.

Enhancements in Immediate Speech Emotion Detection: Harnessing Prosodic and Spectral Characteristics,"Speech is essential to human communication for expressing and understanding feelings. Emotional speech processing has challenges with expert data sampling, dataset organization, and computational complexity in large-scale analysis. This study aims to reduce data redundancy and high dimensionality by introducing a new speech emotion recognition system. The system employs Diffusion Map to reduce dimensionality and includes Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)ensemble classifiers. These strategies are suggested to increase voice emotion recognition accuracy. Speech emotion recognition is gaining popularity in affective computing for usage in medical, industry, and academics. This project aims to provide an efficient and robust real-time emotion identification framework. In order to identify emotions using supervised machine learning models, this work makes use of paralinguistic factors such as intensity, pitch, and MFCC. In order to classify data, experimental analysis integrates prosodic and spectral information utilizing methods like Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, SVM, KNN, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes. Fast training times make these machine learning models excellent for real-time applications. SVM and MLP have the highest accuracy at 70.86% and 79.52%, respectively.

Center-based 3D Object Detection and Tracking,"Three-dimensional objects are commonly represented as 3D boxes in a point-cloud. This representation mimics the well-studied image-based 2D bounding-box detection but comes with additional challenges. Objects in a 3D world do not follow any particular orientation, and box-based detectors have difficulties enumerating all orientations or fitting an axis-aligned bounding box to rotated objects. In this paper, we instead propose to represent, detect, and track 3D objects as points. Our framework, CenterPoint, first detects centers of objects using a keypoint detector and regresses to other attributes, including 3D size, 3D orientation, and velocity. In a second stage, it refines these estimates using additional point features on the object. In CenterPoint, 3D object tracking simplifies to greedy closest-point matching. The resulting detection and tracking algorithm is simple, efficient, and effective. CenterPoint achieved state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for both 3D detection and tracking, with 65.5 NDS and 63.8 AMOTA for a single model. On the Waymo Open Dataset, Center-Point outperforms all previous single model methods by a large margin and ranks first among all Lidar-only submissions.

YOLOv6: A Single-Stage Object Detection Framework for Industrial Applications,"For years, the YOLO series has been the de facto industry-level standard for efficient object detection. The YOLO community has prospered overwhelmingly to enrich its use in a multitude of hardware platforms and abundant scenarios. In this technical report, we strive to push its limits to the next level, stepping forward with an unwavering mindset for industry application. Considering the diverse requirements for speed and accuracy in the real environment, we extensively examine the up-to-date object detection advancements either from industry or academia. Specifically, we heavily assimilate ideas from recent network design, training strategies, testing techniques, quantization, and optimization methods. On top of this, we integrate our thoughts and practice to build a suite of deployment-ready networks at various scales to accommodate diversified use cases.

Impact of heavy metals on the environment and human health: Novel therapeutic insights to counter the toxicity,"Heavy metals are well-known environmental pollutants owing to their toxicity, longevity in the atmosphere, and ability to accumulate in the human body via bioaccumulation. The pollution of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems with toxic heavy metals is a major environmental concern that has consequences for public health. Most heavy metals occur naturally, but a few are derived from anthropogenic sources. Heavy metals are characterized by their high atomic mass and toxicity to living organisms. Most heavy metals cause environmental and atmospheric pollution, and may be lethal to humans. Heavy metals can become strongly toxic by mixing with different environmental elements, such as water, soil, and air, and humans and other living organisms can be exposed to them through the food chain. Plenty of experimental studies were performed to appraise the promising treatment options from natural products. Additionally, nanotechnology based treatment options are being constantly developed. As an emerging field, nanotechnology is making substantial advances in the analysis and removal of heavy metals from complicated matrices. Removal of heavy metal has been accomplished by the use of a variety of nanomaterials, including graphene and its derivatives, magnetic nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes, to name a few. Using nanotechnology for heavy metal analysis and removal from food and water resources provides many benefits over traditional methods. These advantages include a broad linear range, low detection and quantification limits, a high sensitivity, and high selectivity.

Analytical Methods Used in Determining Antioxidant Activity: A Review,"The study of antioxidants and their implications in various fields, from food engineering to medicine and pharmacy, is of major interest to the scientific community. The present paper is a critical presentation of the most important tests used to determine the antioxidant activity, detection mechanism, applicability, advantages and disadvantages of these methods. Out of the tests based on the transfer of a hydrogen atom, the following were presented: the Oxygen Radical Absorption Capacity (ORAC) test, the Hydroxyl Radical Antioxidant Capacity (HORAC) test, the Total Peroxyl Radical Trapping Antioxidant Parameter (TRAP) test, and the Total Oxyradical Scavenging Capacity (TOSC) test. The tests based on the transfer of one electron include the Cupric Reducing Antioxidant Power (CUPRAC) test, the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) test, the Folin–Ciocalteu test. Mixed tests, including the transfer of both a hydrogen atom and an electron, include the 2,2′-Azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) test, and the [2,2-di(4-tert-octylphenyl)-1-picrylhydrazyl] (DPPH) test. All these assays are based on chemical reactions and assessing the kinetics or reaching the equilibrium state relies on spectrophotometry, presupposing the occurrence of characteristic colours or the discolouration of the solutions to be analysed, which are processes monitored by specific wavelength adsorption. These assays were successfully applied in antioxidant analysis or the determination of the antioxidant capacity of complex samples.

Significantly improving the quality of genome assemblies through curation,"Abstract Genome sequence assemblies provide the basis for our understanding of biology. Generating error-free assemblies is therefore the ultimate, but sadly still unachieved goal of a multitude of research projects. Despite the ever-advancing improvements in data generation, assembly algorithms and pipelines, no automated approach has so far reliably generated near error-free genome assemblies for eukaryotes. Whilst working towards improved datasets and fully automated pipelines, assembly evaluation and curation is actively used to bridge this shortcoming and significantly reduce the number of assembly errors.

From The Emancipated Spectator,"Among leftist cultural critics, it often believed that workers and intellectuals are natural allies in the fight for social change. Philosopher Jacques Rancière has been one of the most outspoken critics of this view, suggesting that the Marxist philosophers construct a romanticized notion of the working class as in need of emancipation by enlightened intellectuals. The counterargument— that the intelligentsia should not speak for and presume to know what's best for the masses—runs through much of Rancière's work, from The Philosopher and His Poor (1983) to The Ignorant Schoolmaster (1991). In The Emancipated Spectator (2008), the philosopher extends this principle to theatre, arguing that the artist should not presume to know what the spectator needs. Contrary to Bertolt Brecht (see chapter 35), Augusto Boal (see chapter 39), and others who draw an opposition between individual spectatorship and communal participation, Rancière argues that individual spectatorship ""is not some passive condition that we should transform into activity. It is our normal condition"" (321). A truly progressive theatre, then, is one that respects the individual spectator's ability to think for his or herself.",2025-01-21,2025,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003282969-47,1650,2,1.0,"['Jacques Rancière', 'Gregory Elliott']",,False
Screening for Colorectal Cancer,"Importance: Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, with an estimated 52980 persons in the US projected to die of colorectal cancer in 2021. Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among persons aged 65 to 74 years. It is estimated that 10.5% of new colorectal cancer cases occur in persons younger than 50 years. Incidence of colorectal cancer (specifically adenocarcinoma) in adults aged 40 to 49 years has increased by almost 15% from 2000-2002 to 2014-2016. In 2016, 26% of eligible adults in the US had never been screened for colorectal cancer and in 2018, 31% were not up to date with screening.\nObjective: To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 40 years or older. The review also examined whether these findings varied by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. In addition, as in 2016, the USPSTF commissioned a report from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network Colorectal Cancer Working Group to provide information from comparative modeling on how estimated life-years gained, colorectal cancer cases averted, and colorectal cancer deaths averted vary by different starting and stopping ages for various screening strategies.\nPopulation: Asymptomatic adults 45 years or older at average risk of colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis]).\nEvidence Assessment: The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years has substantial net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened has small net benefit. Adults who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit.\nRecommendation: The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in all adults aged 50 to 75 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of screening all persons in this age group is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the patient's overall health, prior screening history, and preferences.

"Long covid—mechanisms, risk factors, and management","Abstract Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, covid-19 has spread and had a profound effect on the lives and health of people around the globe. As of 4 July 2021, more than 183 million confirmed cases of covid-19 had been recorded worldwide, and 3.97 million deaths. Recent evidence has shown that a range of persistent symptoms can remain long after the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this condition is now coined long covid by recognized research institutes. Studies have shown that long covid can affect the whole spectrum of people with covid-19, from those with very mild acute disease to the most severe forms. Like acute covid-19, long covid can involve multiple organs and can affect many systems including, but not limited to, the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal systems. The symptoms of long covid include fatigue, dyspnea, cardiac abnormalities, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, muscle pain, concentration problems, and headache. This review summarizes studies of the long term effects of covid-19 in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients and describes the persistent symptoms they endure. Risk factors for acute covid-19 and long covid and possible therapeutic options are also discussed.",2021-07-26,2021,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n1648,1648,1,1.0,"['Harry Crook', 'Sanara Raza', 'Joseph Nowell', 'Megan Young', 'Paul Edison']",,False
Current treatment and recent progress in gastric cancer,"Abstract Gastric cancer is not a top‐10 malignancy in the United States but represents one of the most common causes of cancer death worldwide. Biological differences between tumors from Eastern and Western countries add to the complexity of identifying standard‐of‐care therapy based on international trials. Systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy all have proven efficacy in gastric adenocarcinoma; therefore, multidisciplinary treatment is paramount to treatment selection. Triplet chemotherapy for resectable gastric cancer is now accepted and could represent a plateau of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy for localized disease. Classification of gastric cancer based on molecular subtypes is providing an opportunity for personalized therapy. Biomarkers, in particular microsatellite instability (MSI), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‐L1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), tumor mutation burden, and Epstein‐Barr virus, are increasingly driving systemic therapy approaches and allowing for the identification of populations most likely to benefit from immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Significant research opportunities remain for the less differentiated histologic subtypes of gastric adenocarcinoma and those without markers of immunotherapy activity.",2021-02-16,2021,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21657,1647,-1,0.16989854041226232,"['Smita S.

Estimating Distances from Parallaxes. V. Geometric and Photogeometric Distances to 1.47 Billion Stars in Gaia Early Data Release 3,"Abstract Stellar distances constitute a foundational pillar of astrophysics. The publication of 1.47 billion stellar parallaxes from Gaia is a major contribution to this. Despite Gaia’s precision, the majority of these stars are so distant or faint that their fractional parallax uncertainties are large, thereby precluding a simple inversion of parallax to provide a distance. Here we take a probabilistic approach to estimating stellar distances that uses a prior constructed from a three-dimensional model of our Galaxy. This model includes interstellar extinction and Gaia’s variable magnitude limit. We infer two types of distance. The first, geometric, uses the parallax with a direction-dependent prior on distance. The second, photogeometric, additionally uses the color and apparent magnitude of a star, by exploiting the fact that stars of a given color have a restricted range of probable absolute magnitudes (plus extinction). Tests on simulated data and external validations show that the photogeometric estimates generally have higher accuracy and precision for stars with poor parallaxes. We provide a catalog of 1.47 billion geometric and 1.35 billion photogeometric distances together with asymmetric uncertainty measures. Our estimates are quantiles of a posterior probability distribution, so they transform invariably and can therefore also be used directly in the distance modulus ( ). The catalog may be downloaded or queried using ADQL at various sites (see http://www.mpia.de/~calj/gedr3_distances.html ), where it can also be cross-matched with the Gaia catalog.",2021-02-25,2021,https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/abd806,1646,6,1.0,"['C.

Video Swin Transformer,"The vision community is witnessing a modeling shift from CNNs to Transformers, where pure Transformer architectures have attained top accuracy on the major video recognition benchmarks. These video models are all built on Transformer layers that globally connect patches across the spatial and temporal dimensions. In this paper, we instead advocate an inductive bias of locality in video Transformers, which leads to a better speed-accuracy trade-off compared to previous approaches which compute self-attention globally even with spatial-temporal factorization. The locality of the proposed video architecture is realized by adapting the Swin Transformer designed for the image domain, while continuing to leverage the power of pre-trained image models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a broad range of video recognition benchmarks, including on action recognition (84.9 top-l accuracy on Kinetics-400 and 85.9 top-l accuracy on Kinetics-600 with ~20× less pre-training data and ~3× smaller model size) and temporal modeling (69.6 top-l accuracy on Something-Something v2).",2022-06-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr52688.2022.00320,1645,0,1.0,"['Ze Liu', 'Ning Jia', 'Yue Cao', 'Yixuan Wei', 'Zheng Zhang', 'Stephen Lin', 'Han Hu']",,False
Segment anything in medical images,"Abstract Medical image segmentation is a critical component in clinical practice, facilitating accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, existing methods, often tailored to specific modalities or disease types, lack generalizability across the diverse spectrum of medical image segmentation tasks. Here we present MedSAM, a foundation model designed for bridging this gap by enabling universal medical image segmentation. The model is developed on a large-scale medical image dataset with 1,570,263 image-mask pairs, covering 10 imaging modalities and over 30 cancer types. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on 86 internal validation tasks and 60 external validation tasks, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness than modality-wise specialist models.

BRAKER2: automatic eukaryotic genome annotation with GeneMark-EP+ and AUGUSTUS supported by a protein database,"Abstract The task of eukaryotic genome annotation remains challenging. Only a few genomes could serve as standards of annotation achieved through a tremendous investment of human curation efforts. Still, the correctness of all alternative isoforms, even in the best-annotated genomes, could be a good subject for further investigation. The new BRAKER2 pipeline generates and integrates external protein support into the iterative process of training and gene prediction by GeneMark-EP+ and AUGUSTUS. BRAKER2 continues the line started by BRAKER1 where self-training GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS made gene predictions supported by transcriptomic data. Among the challenges addressed by the new pipeline was a generation of reliable hints to protein-coding exon boundaries from likely homologous but evolutionarily distant proteins. In comparison with other pipelines for eukaryotic genome annotation, BRAKER2 is fully automatic. It is favorably compared under equal conditions with other pipelines, e.g. MAKER2, in terms of accuracy and performance. Development of BRAKER2 should facilitate solving the task of harmonization of annotation of protein-coding genes in genomes of different eukaryotic species. However, we fully understand that several more innovations are needed in transcriptomic and proteomic technologies as well as in algorithmic development to reach the goal of highly accurate annotation of eukaryotic genomes.",2021-01-06,2021,https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqaa108,1645,5,0.31673260856893903,"['Tomáš Brůna', 'Katharina J.

Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19),"People are afraid about COVID-19 and are actively talking about it on social media platforms such as Twitter. People are showing their emotions openly in their tweets on Twitter. It's very important to perform sentiment analysis on these tweets for finding COVID-19's impact on people's lives. Natural language processing, textual processing, computational linguists, and biometrics are applied to perform sentiment analysis to identify and extract the emotions. In this work, sentiment analysis is carried out on a large Twitter dataset of English tweets. Ten emotional themes are investigated. Experimental results show that COVID-19 has spread fear/anxiety, gratitude, happiness and hope, and other mixed emotions among people for different reasons. Specifically, it is observed that positive news from top officials like Trump of chloroquine as cure to COVID-19 has suddenly lowered fear in sentiment, and happiness, gratitude, and hope started to rise. But, once FDA said, chloroquine is not effective cure, fear again started to rise.",2021-04-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.4018/ijswis.2021040101,1616,-1,0.049531093313472455,"['Jalal S.

"A Metaverse: Taxonomy, Components, Applications, and Open Challenges","Unlike previous studies on the Metaverse based on Second Life, the current Metaverse is based on the social value of Generation Z that online and offline selves are not different. With the technological development of deep learning-based high-precision recognition models and natural generation models, Metaverse is being strengthened with various factors, from mobile-based always-on access to connectivity with reality using virtual currency. The integration of enhanced social activities and neural-net methods requires a new definition of Metaverse suitable for the present, different from the previous Metaverse. This paper divides the concepts and essential techniques necessary for realizing the Metaverse into three components (i.e., hardware, software, and contents) and three approaches (i.e., user interaction, implementation, and application) rather than marketing or hardware approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we describe essential methods based on three components and techniques to Metaverse&#x2019;s representative Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook research in the domain of films, games, and studies.

Drought Stress Impacts on Plants and Different Approaches to Alleviate Its Adverse Effects,"Drought stress, being the inevitable factor that exists in various environments without recognizing borders and no clear warning thereby hampering plant biomass production, quality, and energy. It is the key important environmental stress that occurs due to temperature dynamics, light intensity, and low rainfall. Despite this, its cumulative, not obvious impact and multidimensional nature severely affects the plant morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular attributes with adverse impact on photosynthetic capacity. Coping with water scarcity, plants evolve various complex resistance and adaptation mechanisms including physiological and biochemical responses, which differ with species level. The sophisticated adaptation mechanisms and regularity network that improves the water stress tolerance and adaptation in plants are briefly discussed. Growth pattern and structural dynamics, reduction in transpiration loss through altering stomatal conductance and distribution, leaf rolling, root to shoot ratio dynamics, root length increment, accumulation of compatible solutes, enhancement in transpiration efficiency, osmotic and hormonal regulation, and delayed senescence are the strategies that are adopted by plants under water deficit. Approaches for drought stress alleviations are breeding strategies, molecular and genomics perspectives with special emphasis on the omics technology alteration i.e., metabolomics, proteomics, genomics, transcriptomics, glyomics and phenomics that improve the stress tolerance in plants. For drought stress induction, seed priming, growth hormones, osmoprotectants, silicon (Si), selenium (Se) and potassium application are worth using under drought stress conditions in plants. In addition, drought adaptation through microbes, hydrogel, nanoparticles applications and metabolic engineering techniques that regulate the antioxidant enzymes activity for adaptation to drought stress in plants, enhancing plant tolerance through maintenance in cell homeostasis and ameliorates the adverse effects of water stress are of great potential in agriculture.",2021-01-28,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/plants10020259,1606,-1,0.042169390872866454,"['Mahmoud F.

tRNAscan-SE 2.0: improved detection and functional classification of transfer RNA genes,"Abstract tRNAscan-SE has been widely used for transfer RNA (tRNA) gene prediction for over twenty years, developed just as the first genomes were decoded. With the massive increase in quantity and phylogenetic diversity of genomes, the accurate detection and functional prediction of tRNAs has become more challenging. Utilizing a vastly larger training set, we created nearly one hundred specialized isotype- and clade-specific models, greatly improving tRNAscan-SE’s ability to identify and classify both typical and atypical tRNAs. We employ a new comparative multi-model strategy where predicted tRNAs are scored against a full set of isotype-specific covariance models, allowing functional prediction based on both the anticodon and the highest-scoring isotype model. Comparative model scoring has also enhanced the program's ability to detect tRNA-derived SINEs and other likely pseudogenes. For the first time, tRNAscan-SE also includes fast and highly accurate detection of mitochondrial tRNAs using newly developed models. Overall, tRNA detection sensitivity and specificity is improved for all isotypes, particularly those utilizing specialized models for selenocysteine and the three subtypes of tRNA genes encoding a CAU anticodon. These enhancements will provide researchers with more accurate and detailed tRNA annotation for a wider variety of tRNAs, and may direct attention to tRNAs with novel traits.",2021-07-27,2021,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab688,1601,5,0.3081751056455771,"['Patricia P.

Text Data Augmentation for Deep Learning,"Abstract Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the most captivating applications of Deep Learning. In this survey, we consider how the Data Augmentation training strategy can aid in its development. We begin with the major motifs of Data Augmentation summarized into strengthening local decision boundaries, brute force training, causality and counterfactual examples, and the distinction between meaning and form. We follow these motifs with a concrete list of augmentation frameworks that have been developed for text data. Deep Learning generally struggles with the measurement of generalization and characterization of overfitting. We highlight studies that cover how augmentations can construct test sets for generalization. NLP is at an early stage in applying Data Augmentation compared to Computer Vision. We highlight the key differences and promising ideas that have yet to be tested in NLP. For the sake of practical implementation, we describe tools that facilitate Data Augmentation such as the use of consistency regularization, controllers, and offline and online augmentation pipelines, to preview a few. Finally, we discuss interesting topics around Data Augmentation in NLP such as task-specific augmentations, the use of prior knowledge in self-supervised learning versus Data Augmentation, intersections with transfer and multi-task learning, and ideas for AI-GAs (AI-Generating Algorithms). We hope this paper inspires further research interest in Text Data Augmentation.",2021-07-19,2021,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-021-00492-0,1600,0,0.21894676348770586,"['Connor Shorten', 'Taghi M.

Global Carbon Budget 2022,"Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodologies to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the year 2021, EFOS increased by 5.1 % relative to 2020, with fossil emissions at 10.1 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (9.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.1 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission (including the cement carbonation sink) of 10.9 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1 (40.0 ± 2.9 GtCO2). Also, for 2021, GATM was 5.2 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.5 ± 0.1 ppm yr−1), SOCEAN was 2.9 ± 0.4 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 3.5 ± 0.9 GtC yr−1, with a BIM of −0.6 GtC yr−1 (i.e. the total estimated sources were too low or sinks were too high). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2021 reached 414.71 ± 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2022 suggest an increase in EFOS relative to 2021 of +1.0 % (0.1 % to 1.9 %) globally and atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 417.2 ppm, more than 50 % above pre-industrial levels (around 278 ppm). Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2021, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use change emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extratropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set.

Exceeding 1.5°C global warming could trigger multiple climate tipping points,"Climate tipping points occur when change in a part of the climate system becomes self-perpetuating beyond a warming threshold, leading to substantial Earth system impacts. Synthesizing paleoclimate, observational, and model-based studies, we provide a revised shortlist of global “core” tipping elements and regional “impact” tipping elements and their temperature thresholds. Current global warming of ~1.1°C above preindustrial temperatures already lies within the lower end of some tipping point uncertainty ranges. Several tipping points may be triggered in the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to &lt;2°C global warming, with many more likely at the 2 to 3°C of warming expected on current policy trajectories.

Identifying Resilient Communities in Road Networks: A Path-Based Embedding Approach,"Effective resilience analysis of road networks is fundamental to building sustainable and disaster prepared cities. Identifying which road segments share similar vulnerabilities is important for pinpointing high-risk areas within the network and implementing measures to safeguard them against future disruptions. Graph-based community detection can be applied to group together areas of the network sharing similar structural vulnerabilities. However, current graph-based community detection methods either struggle with integrating node features during partitioning or do not account for the path-based dependencies in road networks. This paper introduces the Path-based Community Embedding (PCE) model, an approach that leverages path-based embeddings to overcome these limitations. PCE combines the strengths of graph attention networks and Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs) to learn representations that incorporate both local neighborhood information and long-range path dependencies. Our results on the Santa Barbara road network show that PCE improves community detection performance for resilience analysis, thus offering a powerful tool for urban planners and transportation engineers to preemptively identify vulnerabilities in road networks.",2025-01-01,2025,https://doi.org/10.4230/lipics.giscience.2025.9,1589,0,1.0,"['Thomas Kipf', 'Max Welling']",,True

"Mental Health Surveillance Among Children — United States, 2013–2019","Mental health encompasses a range of mental, emotional, social, and behavioral functioning and occurs along a continuum from good to poor. Previous research has documented that mental health among children and adolescents is associated with immediate and long-term physical health and chronic disease, health risk behaviors, social relationships, education, and employment. Public health surveillance of children's mental health can be used to monitor trends in prevalence across populations, increase knowledge about demographic and geographic differences, and support decision-making about prevention and intervention. Numerous federal data systems collect data on various indicators of children's mental health, particularly mental disorders. The 2013-2019 data from these data systems show that mental disorders begin in early childhood and affect children with a range of sociodemographic characteristics. During this period, the most prevalent disorders diagnosed among U.S. children and adolescents aged 3-17 years were attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and anxiety, each affecting approximately one in 11 (9.4%-9.8%) children. Among children and adolescents aged 12-17 years, one fifth (20.9%) had ever experienced a major depressive episode. Among high school students in 2019, 36.7% reported persistently feeling sad or hopeless in the past year, and 18.8% had seriously considered attempting suicide. Approximately seven in 100,000 persons aged 10-19 years died by suicide in 2018 and 2019. Among children and adolescents aged 3-17 years, 9.6%-10.1% had received mental health services, and 7.8% of all children and adolescents aged 3-17 years had taken medication for mental health problems during the past year, based on parent report. Approximately one in four children and adolescents aged 12-17 years reported having received mental health services during the past year. In federal data systems, data on positive indicators of mental health (e.g., resilience) are limited. Although no comprehensive surveillance system for children's mental health exists and no single indicator can be used to define the mental health of children or to identify the overall number of children with mental disorders, these data confirm that mental disorders among children continue to be a substantial public health concern. These findings can be used by public health professionals, health care providers, state health officials, policymakers, and educators to understand the prevalence of specific mental disorders and other indicators of mental health and the challenges related to mental health surveillance.",2022-02-24,2022,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.su7102a1,1584,1,1.0,"['Rebecca H.

Circuit quantum electrodynamics,"Quantum mechanical effects at the macroscopic level were first explored in\nJosephson junction-based superconducting circuits in the 1980's. In the last\ntwenty years, the emergence of quantum information science has intensified\nresearch toward using these circuits as qubits in quantum information\nprocessors. The realization that superconducting qubits can be made to strongly\nand controllably interact with microwave photons, the quantized electromagnetic\nfields stored in superconducting circuits, led to the creation of the field of\ncircuit quantum electrodynamics (QED), the topic of this review. While atomic\ncavity QED inspired many of the early developments of circuit QED, the latter\nhas now become an independent and thriving field of research in its own right.\nCircuit QED allows the study and control of light-matter interaction at the\nquantum level in unprecedented detail. It also plays an essential role in all\ncurrent approaches to quantum information processing with superconducting\ncircuits. In addition, circuit QED enables the study of hybrid quantum systems\ninteracting with microwave photons. Here, we review the coherent coupling of\nsuperconducting qubits to microwave photons in high-quality oscillators\nfocussing on the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings model, its dispersive limit,\nand the different regimes of light-matter interaction in this system. We\ndiscuss coupling of superconducting circuits to their environment, which is\nnecessary for coherent control and measurements in circuit QED, but which also\ninvariably leads to decoherence. Dispersive qubit readout, a central ingredient\nin almost all circuit QED experiments, is also described. Following an\nintroduction to these fundamental concepts that are at the heart of circuit\nQED, we discuss important use cases of these ideas in quantum information\nprocessing and in quantum optics.\n",2021-05-19,2021,https://doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.93.025005,1583,4,0.2604772821414318,"['Alexandre Blais', 'Arne L.

DreamBooth: Fine Tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Subject-Driven Generation,"Large text-to-image models achieved a remarkable leap in the evolution of AI, enabling high-quality and diverse synthesis of images from a given text prompt. However, these models lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different contexts. In this work, we present a new approach for ""personalization"" of text-to-image diffusion models. Given as input just a few images of a subject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can be used to synthesize novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embedded in the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views and lighting conditions that do not appear in the reference images. We apply our technique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization, text-guided view synthesis, and artistic rendering, all while preserving the subject's key features. We also provide a new dataset and evaluation protocol for this new task of subject-driven generation.

"The many lives of active galactic nuclei: Cooling flows, black holes and the luminosities and colours of galaxies","We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance Λ cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for 'radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological 'radio mode' model to be successful.",2024-01-01,2024,https://doi.org/10.25916/sut.26253068.v1,1564,6,0.7867176485207674,"['Darren Croton', 'Volker Springel', 'Simon D.

Survival depends on both stage and molecular subtype. Invasive BCs comprise wide spectrum tumors that show a variation concerning their clinical presentation, behavior, and morphology. Based on mRNA gene expression levels, BC can be divided into molecular subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like). The molecular subtypes provide insights into new treatment strategies and patient stratifications that impact the management of BC patients.

Two events impacted 2020 MS data collection and related statistics: the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU. In 2020, the first and second most reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The EU trend for confirmed human cases of these two diseases was stable (flat) from 2016 to 2020. Fourteen of the 26 MS reporting data on <i>Salmonella</i> control programmes in poultry met the reduction targets for all poultry categories. <i>Salmonella</i> results for carcases of various species performed by competent authorities were more frequently positive than own-checks conducted by food business operators. This was also the case for <i>Campylobacter</i> quantification results from broiler carcases for the MS group that submitted data from both samplers, whereas overall at EU level, those percentages were comparable.

Factors Associated with Membership in a Mutual Health Insurance Fund in the Thiès Region (Senegal) in 2023: Article," Introduction : Mutual health insurance constitutes a micro-insurance system which facilitates access to care by avoiding direct payment. They represent one of the pillars of our Universal Health Coverage. After years of existence and despite political commitment, community support for mutual health insurance remains low until now. The objective of our work was to study the factors linked to the membership of mutual health insurance companies in the Thiès region and to propose solutions.  Methodology : The study was cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical. It was carried out among a sample of 1,300 people, residing in the Thiès region for at least 6 months, chosen following a three-stage cluster survey. A questionnaire was used to collect data related to predisposing, facilitating and health system factors. These data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 21 software. The significance value was P &lt; 0.05. The Odds ratio was used to measure the strength of the link.  Results : The average age is 42 years and among the people surveyed 75.3% lived in an urban area, 84.5% claimed to know mutual insurance companies. The number of dependent children among the people surveyed was 9 and 90% had an income-generating activity, married people were 82.9% and 78.2% were educated. The mutual penetration rate was 69.3%.

Management of Immune-Related Adverse Events in Patients Treated With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy: ASCO Guideline Update,"PURPOSE To increase awareness, outline strategies, and offer guidance on the recommended management of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy. METHODS A multidisciplinary panel of medical oncology, dermatology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, pulmonology, endocrinology, neurology, hematology, emergency medicine, nursing, trialists, and advocacy experts was convened to update the guideline. Guideline development involved a systematic literature review and an informal consensus process. The systematic review focused on evidence published from 2017 through 2021. RESULTS A total of 175 studies met the eligibility criteria of the systematic review and were pertinent to the development of the recommendations. Because of the paucity of high-quality evidence, recommendations are based on expert consensus. RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations for specific organ system–based toxicity diagnosis and management are presented. While management varies according to the organ system affected, in general, ICPi therapy should be continued with close monitoring for grade 1 toxicities, except for some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxicities. ICPi therapy may be suspended for most grade 2 toxicities, with consideration of resuming when symptoms revert ≤ grade 1. Corticosteroids may be administered. Grade 3 toxicities generally warrant suspension of ICPis and the initiation of high-dose corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be tapered over the course of at least 4-6 weeks. Some refractory cases may require other immunosuppressive therapy. In general, permanent discontinuation of ICPis is recommended with grade 4 toxicities, except for endocrinopathies that have been controlled by hormone replacement.

"CARD 2023: expanded curation, support for machine learning, and resistome prediction at the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database","Abstract The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD; card.mcmaster.ca) combines the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO) with curated AMR gene (ARG) sequences and resistance-conferring mutations to provide an informatics framework for annotation and interpretation of resistomes. As of version 3.2.4, CARD encompasses 6627 ontology terms, 5010 reference sequences, 1933 mutations, 3004 publications, and 5057 AMR detection models that can be used by the accompanying Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) software to annotate genomic or metagenomic sequences. Focused curation enhancements since 2020 include expanded β-lactamase curation, incorporation of likelihood-based AMR mutations for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, addition of disinfectants and antiseptics plus their associated ARGs, and systematic curation of resistance-modifying agents. This expanded curation includes 180 new AMR gene families, 15 new drug classes, 1 new resistance mechanism, and two new ontological relationships: evolutionary_variant_of and is_small_molecule_inhibitor. In silico prediction of resistomes and prevalence statistics of ARGs has been expanded to 377 pathogens, 21,079 chromosomes, 2,662 genomic islands, 41,828 plasmids and 155,606 whole-genome shotgun assemblies, resulting in collation of 322,710 unique ARG allele sequences.

First Sagittarius A* Event Horizon Telescope Results. I. The Shadow of the Supermassive Black Hole in the Center of the Milky Way,"Abstract We present the first Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the Galactic center source associated with a supermassive black hole. These observations were conducted in 2017 using a global interferometric array of eight telescopes operating at a wavelength of λ = 1.3 mm. The EHT data resolve a compact emission region with intrahour variability. A variety of imaging and modeling analyses all support an image that is dominated by a bright, thick ring with a diameter of 51.8 ± 2.3 μ as (68% credible interval). The ring has modest azimuthal brightness asymmetry and a comparatively dim interior. Using a large suite of numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the EHT images of Sgr A* are consistent with the expected appearance of a Kerr black hole with mass ∼4 × 10 6 M ⊙ , which is inferred to exist at this location based on previous infrared observations of individual stellar orbits, as well as maser proper-motion studies. Our model comparisons disfavor scenarios where the black hole is viewed at high inclination ( i &gt; 50°), as well as nonspinning black holes and those with retrograde accretion disks. Our results provide direct evidence for the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, and for the first time we connect the predictions from dynamical measurements of stellar orbits on scales of 10 3 –10 5 gravitational radii to event-horizon-scale images and variability. Furthermore, a comparison with the EHT results for the supermassive black hole M87* shows consistency with the predictions of general relativity spanning over three orders of magnitude in central mass.",2022-05-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/ac6674,1534,6,1.0,"['Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration', 'Kazunori Akiyama', 'A.

"Gastric Cancer, Version 2.2022, NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology","Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Over 95% of gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas, which are typically classified based on anatomic location and histologic type. Gastric cancer generally carries a poor prognosis because it is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Systemic therapy can provide palliation, improved survival, and enhanced quality of life in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. The implementation of biomarker testing, especially analysis of HER2 status, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), has had a significant impact on clinical practice and patient care. Targeted therapies including trastuzumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab have produced encouraging results in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Palliative management, which may include systemic therapy, chemoradiation, and/or best supportive care, is recommended for all patients with unresectable or metastatic cancer.

PCT: Point cloud transformer,"The irregular domain and lack of ordering make it challenging to design deep neural networks for point cloud processing. This paper presents a novel framework named Point Cloud Transformer (PCT) for point cloud learning. PCT is based on Transformer, which achieves huge success in natural language processing and displays great potential in image processing.

Global burden of liver disease: 2023 update,"Liver disease accounts for two million deaths annually and is responsible for 4% of all deaths (1 out of every 25 deaths worldwide); approximately two-thirds of all liver-related deaths occur in men. Deaths are largely attributable to complications of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, with acute hepatitis accounting for a smaller proportion of deaths. The most common causes of cirrhosis worldwide are related to viral hepatitis, alcohol, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Hepatotropic viruses are the aetiological factor in most cases of acute hepatitis, but drug-induced liver injury increasingly accounts for a significant proportion of cases.

The exosome journey: from biogenesis to uptake and intracellular signalling,"Abstract The use of exosomes in clinical settings is progressively becoming a reality, as clinical trials testing exosomes for diagnostic and therapeutic applications are generating remarkable interest from the scientific community and investors. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles secreted by all cell types playing intercellular communication roles in health and disease by transferring cellular cargoes such as functional proteins, metabolites and nucleic acids to recipient cells. An in-depth understanding of exosome biology is therefore essential to ensure clinical development of exosome based investigational therapeutic products. Here we summarise the most up-to-date knowkedge about the complex biological journey of exosomes from biogenesis and secretion, transport and uptake to their intracellular signalling. We delineate the major pathways and molecular players that influence each step of exosome physiology, highlighting the routes of interest, which will be of benefit to exosome manipulation and engineering. We highlight the main controversies in the field of exosome research: their adequate definition, characterisation and biogenesis at plasma membrane. We also delineate the most common identified pitfalls affecting exosome research and development. Unravelling exosome physiology is key to their ultimate progression towards clinical applications.",2021-04-23,2021,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00730-1,1515,3,1.0,"['Sonam Gurung', 'Dany Perocheau', 'Loukia Touramanidou', 'Julien Baruteau']",,True

Global Carbon Budget 2021,"Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize datasets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the first time, an approach is shown to reconcile the difference in our ELUC estimate with the one from national greenhouse gas inventories, supporting the assessment of collective countries' climate progress. For the year 2020, EFOS declined by 5.4 % relative to 2019, with fossil emissions at 9.5 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (9.3 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 0.9 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission of 10.2 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1 (37.4 ± 2.9 GtCO2). Also, for 2020, GATM was 5.0 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.4 ± 0.1 ppm yr−1), SOCEAN was 3.0 ± 0.4 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 2.9 ± 1 GtC yr−1, with a BIM of −0.8 GtC yr−1. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2020 reached 412.45 ± 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2021 suggest a rebound in EFOS relative to 2020 of +4.8 % (4.2 % to 5.4 %) globally. Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2020, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use changes emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update documents changes in the methods and datasets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this dataset (Friedlingstein et al., 2020, 2019; Le Quéré et al., 2018b, a, 2016, 2015b, a, 2014, 2013).

"Genomics and epidemiology of the P.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineage in Manaus, Brazil","Unmitigated spread in Brazil Despite an extensive network of primary care availability, Brazil has suffered profoundly during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Using daily data from state health offices, Castro et al. analyzed the pattern of spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country from February to October 2020. Clusters of deaths before cases became apparent indicated unmitigated spread. SARS-CoV-2 circulated undetected in Brazil for more than a month as it spread north from Sã o Paulo. In Manaus, transmission reached unprecedented levels after a momentary respite in mid-2020. Faria et al. tracked the evolution of a new, more aggressive lineage called P.1, which has 17 mutations, including three (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) in the spike protein. After a period of accelerated evolution, this variant emerged in Brazil during November 2020. Coupled with the emergence of P.1, disease spread was accelerated by stark local inequalities and political upheaval, which compromised a prompt federal response.

2024 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures,"Abstract This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including prevalence and incidence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care and the ramifications of AD for family caregivers, the dementia workforce and society. The Special Report discusses the larger health care system for older adults with cognitive issues, focusing on the role of caregivers and non‐physician health care professionals. An estimated 6.9 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060, barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or cure AD. Official AD death certificates recorded 119,399 deaths from AD in 2021. In 2020 and 2021, when COVID‐19 entered the ranks of the top ten causes of death, Alzheimer's was the seventh‐leading cause of death in the United States. Official counts for more recent years are still being compiled. Alzheimer's remains the fifth‐leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2021, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 140%. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.4 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2023. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $346.6 billion in 2023. Its costs, however, extend to unpaid caregivers’ increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes. Members of the paid health care and broader community‐based workforce are involved in diagnosing, treating and caring for people with dementia. However, the United States faces growing shortages across different segments of the dementia care workforce due to a combination of factors, including the absolute increase in the number of people living with dementia. Therefore, targeted programs and care delivery models will be needed to attract, better train and effectively deploy health care and community‐based workers to provide dementia care. Average per‐person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are almost three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 22 times as great. Total payments in 2024 for health care, long‐term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $360 billion.

Predicting Depression via Social Media,"Major depression constitutes a serious challenge in personal and public health. Tens of millions of people each year suffer from depression and only a fraction receives adequate treatment. We explore the potential to use social media to detect and diagnose major depressive disorder in individuals. We first employ crowdsourcing to compile a set of Twitter users who report being diagnosed with clinical depression, based on a standard psychometric instrument. Through their social media postings over a year preceding the onset of depression, we measure behavioral attributes relating to social engagement, emotion, language and linguistic styles, ego network, and mentions of antidepressant medications. We leverage these behavioral cues, to build a statistical classifier that provides estimates of the risk of depression, before the reported onset. We find that social media contains useful signals for characterizing the onset of depression in individuals, as measured through decrease in social activity, raised negative affect, highly clustered egonetworks, heightened relational and medicinal concerns, and greater expression of religious involvement. We believe our findings and methods may be useful in developing tools for identifying the onset of major depression, for use by healthcare agencies; or on behalf of individuals, enabling those suffering from depression to be more proactive about their mental health.",2021-08-03,2021,https://doi.org/10.1609/icwsm.v7i1.14432,1495,-1,0.07138357779198724,"['Munmun De Choudhury', 'Michael Gamon', 'Scott Counts', 'Eric Horvitz']",,True

Recent Strategies to Develop Innovative Photosensitizers for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy,"This review presents a robust strategy to design photosensitizers (PSs) for various species. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a photochemical-based treatment approach that involves the use of light combined with a light-activated chemical, referred to as a PS. Attractively, PDT is one of the alternatives to conventional cancer treatment due to its noninvasive nature, high cure rates, and low side effects. PSs play an important factor in photoinduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Although the concept of photosensitizer-based photodynamic therapy has been widely adopted for clinical trials and bioimaging, until now, to our surprise, there has been no relevant review article on rational designs of organic PSs for PDT. Furthermore, most of published review articles in PDT focused on nanomaterials and nanotechnology based on traditional PSs. Therefore, this review aimed at reporting recent strategies to develop innovative organic photosensitizers for enhanced photodynamic therapy, with each example described in detail instead of providing only a general overview, as is typically done in previous reviews of PDT, to provide intuitive, vivid, and specific insights to the readers.",2021-09-28,2021,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c00381,1493,-1,0.2625891641027177,"['Thanh Chung Pham', 'Nguyễn Văn Nghĩa', 'Yeonghwan Choi', 'Songyi Lee', 'Juyoung Yoon']",,False

What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature,"An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.",2023-04-18,2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci13040410,1491,2,0.7258189632056592,['Chung Kwan Lo'],,True

A continual learning survey: Defying forgetting in classification tasks,"Artificial neural networks thrive in solving the classification problem for a particular rigid task, acquiring knowledge through generalized learning behaviour from a distinct training phase. The resulting network resembles a static entity of knowledge, with endeavours to extend this knowledge without targeting the original task resulting in a catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning shifts this paradigm towards networks that can continually accumulate knowledge over different tasks without the need to retrain from scratch. We focus on task incremental classification, where tasks arrive sequentially and are delineated by clear boundaries. Our main contributions concern: (1) a taxonomy and extensive overview of the state-of-the-art; (2) a novel framework to continually determine the stability-plasticity trade-off of the continual learner; (3) a comprehensive experimental comparison of 11 state-of-the-art continual learning methods; and (4) baselines. We empirically scrutinize method strengths and weaknesses on three benchmarks, considering Tiny Imagenet and large-scale unbalanced iNaturalist and a sequence of recognition datasets. We study the influence of model capacity, weight decay and dropout regularization, and the order in which the tasks are presented, and qualitatively compare methods in terms of required memory, computation time, and storage.",2021-01-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/tpami.2021.3057446,1488,0,1.0,"['Matthias Delange', 'Rahaf Aljundi', 'Marc Masana', 'Sarah Parisot', 'Xu Jia', 'Aleš Leonardis', 'Greg Slabaugh', 'Tinne Tuytelaars']",,True
Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4,"Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction.

The Catalog contains variant-trait associations and supporting metadata for &amp;gt;45 000 published GWAS across &amp;gt;5000 human traits, and &amp;gt;40 000 full P-value summary statistics datasets. Content is curated from publications or acquired via author submission of prepublication summary statistics through a new submission portal and validation tool. GWAS data volume has vastly increased in recent years. We have updated our software to meet this scaling challenge and to enable rapid release of submitted summary statistics. The scope of the repository has expanded to include additional data types of high interest to the community, including sequencing-based GWAS, gene-based analyses and copy number variation analyses. Community outreach has increased the number of shared datasets from under-represented traits, e.g. cancer, and we continue to contribute to awareness of the lack of population diversity in GWAS.

Pattern recognition receptors in health and diseases,"Abstract Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are a class of receptors that can directly recognize the specific molecular structures on the surface of pathogens, apoptotic host cells, and damaged senescent cells. PRRs bridge nonspecific immunity and specific immunity. Through the recognition and binding of ligands, PRRs can produce nonspecific anti-infection, antitumor, and other immunoprotective effects. Most PRRs in the innate immune system of vertebrates can be classified into the following five types based on protein domain homology: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), and absent in melanoma-2 (AIM2)-like receptors (ALRs). PRRs are basically composed of ligand recognition domains, intermediate domains, and effector domains. PRRs recognize and bind their respective ligands and recruit adaptor molecules with the same structure through their effector domains, initiating downstream signaling pathways to exert effects. In recent years, the increased researches on the recognition and binding of PRRs and their ligands have greatly promoted the understanding of different PRRs signaling pathways and provided ideas for the treatment of immune-related diseases and even tumors. This review describes in detail the history, the structural characteristics, ligand recognition mechanism, the signaling pathway, the related disease, new drugs in clinical trials and clinical therapy of different types of PRRs, and discusses the significance of the research on pattern recognition mechanism for the treatment of PRR-related diseases.",2021-08-04,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00687-0,1477,3,0.35738445891536946,"['Danyang Li', 'Minghua Wu']",,True

Exceptional topology of non-Hermitian systems,"The current understanding of the role of topology in non-Hermitian (NH) systems and its far-reaching physical consequences observable in a range of dissipative settings are reviewed. In particular, how the paramount and genuinely NH concept of exceptional degeneracies, at which both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, leads to phenomena drastically distinct from the familiar Hermitian realm is discussed. An immediate consequence is the ubiquitous occurrence of nodal NH topological phases with concomitant open Fermi-Seifert surfaces, where conventional band-touching points are replaced by the aforementioned exceptional degeneracies. Furthermore, new notions of gapped phases including topological phases in single-band systems are detailed, and the manner in which a given physical context may affect the symmetry-based topological classification is clarified. A unique property of NH systems with relevance beyond the field of topological phases consists of the anomalous relation between bulk and boundary physics, stemming from the striking sensitivity of NH matrices to boundary conditions. Unifying several complementary insights recently reported in this context, a picture of intriguing phenomena such as the NH bulk-boundary correspondence and the NH skin effect is put together. Finally, applications of NH topology in both classical systems including optical setups with gain and loss, electric circuits,s and mechanical systems and genuine quantum systems such as electronic transport settings at material junctions and dissipative cold-atom setups are reviewed.",2021-02-24,2021,https://doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.93.015005,1475,-1,0.22537887379999472,"['Emil J.

Interaction Region Indicator: A Simple Real Space Function Clearly Revealing Both Chemical Bonds and Weak Interactions**,"Abstract Graphically revealing interaction regions in a chemical system enables chemists to quickly recognize where significant interactions have formed. Reduced density gradient (RDG) has already been widely employed in literatures to visually exhibit weak interaction regions, in fact it also has the ability of revealing chemical bonding regions. Unfortunately, RDG cannot clearly show both types of the interactions at the same time. In this work, we propose a new real space function named interaction region indicator (IRI), which is a slight modification on RDG. We found IRI can reveal chemical bonding and weak interaction regions equally well, which brings great convenience in the study of various chemical systems as well as chemical reactions. IRI is also compared with atom‐in‐molecules (AIM) topology analysis of electron density, it is demonstrated that IRI has the ability to reveal additional interactions to provide chemists a more complete picture. In addition, we put forward a variant of IRI named IRI‐π, which is dedicated to reveal interactions of π electrons. It is found that IRI‐π can not only distinguish type of π interactions but also exhibit π‐interaction strength. IRI and IRI‐π have been efficiently implemented in our freely available Multiwfn wavefunction analysis code ( http://sobereva.com/multiwfn ), and are expected to become new useful members of computational chemists′ toolbox in studying chemical problems.",2021-05-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/cmtd.202100007,1473,4,1.0,"['Tian Lu', 'Qinxue Chen']",,True

LNCcation: lncRNA localization and function,"Subcellular localization of RNAs has gained attention in recent years as a prevalent phenomenon that influences numerous cellular processes. This is also evident for the large and relatively novel class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Because lncRNAs are defined as RNA transcripts &amp;gt;200 nucleotides that do not encode protein, they are themselves the functional units, making their subcellular localization critical to their function. The discovery of tens of thousands of lncRNAs and the cumulative evidence involving them in almost every cellular activity render assessment of their subcellular localization essential to fully understanding their biology. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of lncRNA subcellular localization, factors controlling their localization, emerging themes, including the role of lncRNA isoforms and the involvement of lncRNAs in phase separation bodies, and the implications of lncRNA localization on their function and on cellular behavior. We also discuss gaps in the current knowledge as well as opportunities that these provide for novel avenues of investigation.",2021-01-19,2021,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202009045,1470,5,1.0,"['Mary Catherine Bridges', 'Amanda C.

Multivariate Data Analysis,"Different chapters within this book and the literature prove the ToF-SIMS as a powerful surface analysis tool. However, one large drawback is that data analysis can be challenging and is very time-consuming compared to the measurement time and to other analysis techniques. Often only a small subset of data is analysed, e.g. a peak list of a few selected signals. Nowadays, data sets often get more complex, as the instruments are highly automated and even three-dimensional (3D) data sets can be easily acquired. In addition, the combination of different analysis techniques within the instrument or different surface analysis techniques leads to more complex data sets with high amounts of hidden meaningful information. To aid the analysis of these large data sets, multivariate data analysis (MVA) has for many years proven to be a powerful tool. For the successful application of MVA methods, the right data pretreatment and understanding of the method are crucial. The basics of the usage of MVA leading to meaningful results are summarized in this chapter. Besides, particular emphasis will be on developments within the last decade: the identification of small differences in spectra (e.g. for forensic analysis), concepts to simplify data interpretation of MVA results and applications in machine learning.",2025-06-06,2025,https://doi.org/10.1039/9781837674763-00229,1468,-1,0.024888581083110286,['Danica Heller‐Krippendorf'],,False

Image Super-Resolution Via Iterative Refinement,"We present SR3, an approach to image Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement. SR3 adapts denoising diffusion probabilistic models (Ho et al. 2020), (Sohl-Dickstein et al. 2015) to image-to-image translation, and performs super-resolution through a stochastic iterative denoising process. Output images are initialized with pure Gaussian noise and iteratively refined using a U-Net architecture that is trained on denoising at various noise levels, conditioned on a low-resolution input image. SR3 exhibits strong performance on super-resolution tasks at different magnification factors, on faces and natural images. We conduct human evaluation on a standard 8× face super-resolution task on CelebA-HQ for which SR3 achieves a fool rate close to 50%, suggesting photo-realistic outputs, while GAN baselines do not exceed a fool rate of 34%. We evaluate SR3 on a 4× super-resolution task on ImageNet, where SR3 outperforms baselines in human evaluation and classification accuracy of a ResNet-50 classifier trained on high-resolution images. We further show the effectiveness of SR3 in cascaded image generation, where a generative model is chained with super-resolution models to synthesize high-resolution images with competitive FID scores on the class-conditional 256×256 ImageNet generation challenge.",2022-01-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/tpami.2022.3204461,1451,0,0.6812691542323397,"['Chitwan Saharia', 'Jonathan Ho', 'William Chan', 'Tim Salimans', 'David J.

Macrophages in immunoregulation and therapeutics,"Abstract Macrophages exist in various tissues, several body cavities, and around mucosal surfaces and are a vital part of the innate immune system for host defense against many pathogens and cancers. Macrophages possess binary M1/M2 macrophage polarization settings, which perform a central role in an array of immune tasks via intrinsic signal cascades and, therefore, must be precisely regulated. Many crucial questions about macrophage signaling and immune modulation are yet to be uncovered. In addition, the clinical importance of tumor-associated macrophages is becoming more widely recognized as significant progress has been made in understanding their biology. Moreover, they are an integral part of the tumor microenvironment, playing a part in the regulation of a wide variety of processes including angiogenesis, extracellular matrix transformation, cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, immunosuppression, and resistance to chemotherapeutic and checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Herein, we discuss immune regulation in macrophage polarization and signaling, mechanical stresses and modulation, metabolic signaling pathways, mitochondrial and transcriptional, and epigenetic regulation. Furthermore, we have broadly extended the understanding of macrophages in extracellular traps and the essential roles of autophagy and aging in regulating macrophage functions. Moreover, we discussed recent advances in macrophages-mediated immune regulation of autoimmune diseases and tumorigenesis. Lastly, we discussed targeted macrophage therapy to portray prospective targets for therapeutic strategies in health and diseases.",2023-05-22,2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01452-1,1449,3,0.7857954617060053,"['Shanze Chen', 'Abdullah F.

It not only enables people to produce a much greater number of variations in the circumstances than nature spontaneously offers, but, moreover, in thousands of cases, to produce the precise sort of variation which they are in want of for discovering the law of the phenomenon; a service which nature, being constructed on a quite different scheme from that of facilitating their studies, is seldom so friendly as to bestow upon them.

IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,"Assume that we observe a large number of signals, all of them with identical, although unknown, shape, but with a different random shift.The objective is to estimate the individual time shifts and their distribution.Such an objective appears in several biological applications like neuroscience or ECG signal processing, in which the estimation of the distribution of the elapsed time between repetitive pulses with a possibly low signal-noise ratio, and without a knowledge of the pulse shape is of interest.We suggest an M-estimator leading to a three-stage algorithm: we first split our data set in blocks, then the shift estimation in each block is done by minimizing a cost function based on the periodogram; the estimated shifts are eventually plugged into a standard density estimator.We show that under mild regularity assumptions the density estimate converges weakly to the true shift distribution.The theory is applied both to simulations and to alignment of real ECG signals.The proposed approach outperforms the standard methods for curve alignment and shift density estimation, even in the case of low signal-to-noise ratio, and is robust to numerous perturbations common in ECG signals.",2023-10-10,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsp.78,1439,-1,0.23200591674593657,[],,False

MLP-Mixer: An all-MLP Architecture for Vision,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the go-to model for computer vision. Recently, attention-based networks, such as the Vision Transformer, have also become popular. In this paper we show that while convolutions and attention are both sufficient for good performance, neither of them are necessary. We present MLP-Mixer, an architecture based exclusively on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). MLP-Mixer contains two types of layers: one with MLPs applied independently to image patches (i.e. ""mixing"" the per-location features), and one with MLPs applied across patches (i.e. ""mixing"" spatial information). When trained on large datasets, or with modern regularization schemes, MLP-Mixer attains competitive scores on image classification benchmarks, with pre-training and inference cost comparable to state-of-the-art models.

"On the Road to 6G: Visions, Requirements, Key Technologies, and Testbeds","&lt;p&gt;Fifth generation (5G) mobile communication systems have entered the stage of commercial deployment, providing users with new services, improved user experiences as well as a host of novel opportunities to various industries. However, 5G still faces many challenges. To address these challenges, international industrial, academic, and standards organizations have commenced research on sixth generation (6G) wireless communication systems. A series of white papers and survey papers have been published, which aim to define 6G in terms of requirements, application scenarios, key technologies, etc. Although ITU-R has been working on the 6G vision and it is expected to reach a consensus on what 6G will be by mid-2023, the related global discussions are still wide open and the existing literature has identified numerous open issues. This paper first provides a comprehensive portrayal of the 6G vision, technical requirements, and application scenarios, covering the current common understanding of 6G. Then, a critical appraisal of the 6G network architecture and key technologies is presented. Furthermore, existing testbeds and advanced 6G verification platforms are detailed for the first time. In addition, future research directions and open challenges are identified to stimulate the on-going global debate.

Constrained Markov Decision Processes,"This report presents a unified approach for the study of constrained Markov decision processes with a countable state space and unbounded costs. We consider a single controller having several objectives; it is desirable to design a controller that minimize one of cost objective, subject to inequality constraints on other cost objectives. The objectives that we study are both the expected average cost, as well as the expected total cost (of which the discounted cost is a special case). We provide two frameworks: the case were costs are bounded below, as well as the contracting framework. We characterize the set of achievable expected occupation measures as well as performance vectors. This allows us to reduce the original control dynamic problem into an infinite Linear Programming.

Single‐Junction Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 19% Efficiency,"Abstract Improving power conversion efficiency (PCE) is important for broadening the applications of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, a maximum PCE of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) is achieved in single‐junction OPV cells by combining material design with a ternary blending strategy. An active layer comprising a new wide‐bandgap polymer donor named PBQx‐TF and a new low‐bandgap non‐fullerene acceptor (NFA) named eC9‐2Cl is rationally designed. With optimized light utilization, the resulting binary cell exhibits a good PCE of 17.7%. An NFA F‐BTA3 is then added to the active layer as a third component to simultaneously improve the photovoltaic parameters. The improved light unitization, cascaded energy level alignment, and enhanced intermolecular packing result in open‐circuit voltage of 0.879 V, short‐circuit current density of 26.7 mA cm −2 , and fill factor of 0.809. This study demonstrates that further improvement of PCEs of high‐performance OPV cells requires fine tuning of the electronic structures and morphologies of the active layers.",2021-08-31,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202102420,1409,4,0.5907140696673966,"['Yong Cui', 'Ye Xu', 'Huifeng Yao', 'Pengqing Bi', 'Ling Hong', 'Jianqi Zhang', 'Yunfei Zu', 'Tao Zhang', 'Jinzhao Qin', 'Junzhen Ren', 'Zhihao Chen', 'Chang He', 'Xiaotao Hao', 'Zhixiang Wei', 'Jianhui Hou']",,False
The Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α) in Autoimmune Disease and Current TNF-α Inhibitors in Therapeutics,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) was initially recognized as a factor that causes the necrosis of tumors, but it has been recently identified to have additional important functions as a pathological component of autoimmune diseases. TNF-α binds to two different receptors, which initiate signal transduction pathways. These pathways lead to various cellular responses, including cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation. However, the inappropriate or excessive activation of TNF-α signaling is associated with chronic inflammation and can eventually lead to the development of pathological complications such as autoimmune diseases. Understanding of the TNF-α signaling mechanism has been expanded and applied for the treatment of immune diseases, which has resulted in the development of effective therapeutic tools, including TNF-α inhibitors. Currently, clinically approved TNF-α inhibitors have shown noticeable potency in a variety of autoimmune diseases, and novel TNF-α signaling inhibitors are being clinically evaluated. In this review, we briefly introduce the impact of TNF-α signaling on autoimmune diseases and its inhibitors, which are used as therapeutic agents against autoimmune diseases.",2021-03-08,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22052719,1408,3,0.4060488483360459,"['Dan-in Jang', 'A-Hyeon Lee', 'Hye-Yoon Shin', 'Hyo-Ryeong Song', 'Jong-Hwi Park', 'Tae‐Bong Kang', 'Sang‐Ryong Lee', 'Seung‐Hoon Yang']",,True

VFDB 2022: a general classification scheme for bacterial virulence factors,"Abstract The virulence factor database (VFDB, http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/) is dedicated to presenting a comprehensive knowledge base and a versatile analysis platform for bacterial virulence factors (VFs). Recent developments in sequencing technologies have led to increasing demands to analyze potential VFs within microbiome data that always consist of many different bacteria. Nevertheless, the current classification of VFs from various pathogens is based on different schemes, which create a chaotic situation and form a barrier for the easy application of the VFDB dataset for future panbacterial metagenomic analyses. Therefore, based on extensive literature mining, we recently proposed a general category of bacterial VFs in the database and reorganized the VFDB dataset accordingly. Thus, all known bacterial VFs from 32 genera of common bacterial pathogens collected in the VFDB are well grouped into 14 basal categories along with over 100 subcategories in a hierarchical architecture. The new coherent and well-defined VFDB dataset will be feasible and applicable for future panbacterial analysis in terms of virulence factors. In addition, we introduced a redesigned JavaScript-independent web interface for the VFDB website to make the database readily accessible to all users with various client settings worldwide.",2021-10-21,2021,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab1107,1401,5,0.6421024960664937,"['Bo Liu', 'Dandan Zheng', 'Siyu Zhou', 'Lihong Chen', 'Jian Yang']",,True
Airborne transmission of respiratory viruses,"Mechanisms of airborne transmission The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted controversies and unknowns about how respiratory pathogens spread between hosts. Traditionally, it was thought that respiratory pathogens spread between people through large droplets produced in coughs and through contact with contaminated surfaces (fomites). However, several respiratory pathogens are known to spread through small respiratory aerosols, which can float and travel in air flows, infecting people who inhale them at short and long distances from the infected person. Wang et al . review recent advances in understanding airborne transmission gained from studying the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and other respiratory pathogens. The authors suggest that airborne transmission may be the dominant form of transmission for several respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, and that further understanding of the mechanisms underlying infection from the airborne route will better inform mitigation measures. —GKA",2021-08-26,2021,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abd9149,1401,1,0.22406899062434177,"['Chia C.

Overview of the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) Standard and its Applications,"Versatile Video Coding (VVC) was finalized in July 2020 as the most recent international video coding standard. It was developed by the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) of the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) to serve an ever-growing need for improved video compression as well as to support a wider variety of today’s media content and emerging applications. This paper provides an overview of the novel technical features for new applications and the core compression technologies for achieving significant bit rate reductions in the neighborhood of 50% over its predecessor for equal video quality, the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, and 75% over the currently most-used format, the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) standard. It is explained how these new features in VVC provide greater versatility for applications. Highlighted applications include video with resolutions beyond standard- and high-definition, video with high dynamic range and wide color gamut, adaptive streaming with resolution changes, computer-generated and screen-captured video, ultralow-delay streaming, 360° immersive video, and multilayer coding e.g., for scalability.

The Jigsaw Classroom,"In this chapter, Elliot Aronson describes the back story behind how he and his graduate student invented the jigsaw classroom, how it was born of necessity out of the interracial turmoil that followed the desegregation of schools in Austin Texas. After systematically observing the classrooms, we determined that one of the major causes of the turmoil was the highly competitive nature of the classroom interacting with the unequal preparation of the children of the three major ethnic groups. Specifically, the black and Latino students, having been educated in sub-standard schools, entered the newly desegregated classroom one full grade level behind their Anglo classmates in reading comprehension. This discrepancy, in a highly competitive classroom, worked to exacerbate existing stereotypes and ethnic prejudice. The result was discomfort, taunting, and aggression.
 The jigsaw strategy “forced” students to cooperate with one another in order to learn the day’s lesson. This required them to pay close attention to listen, and even to assist one another. In the process, students began to appreciate positive aspects of their classmates that had previously been hidden by prejudice and discomfort. In controlled experiments, it was found that students in jigsaw classrooms mastered the material better than students in traditional classrooms. They also liked school better (absenteeism was lower than in traditional classrooms), their liking for one another increased, and they showed greater empathy than students in traditional classrooms.
 The results of the initial experiment have been replicated in dozens of classrooms in various sections of the country. The jigsaw strategy has now been employed in thousands of classrooms throughout the world.",2021-02-05,2021,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003106760-7,1394,2,0.4336450214787082,['Elliot Aronson'],,False

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in the environment,"Over the past several years, the term PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) has grown to be emblematic of environmental contamination, garnering public, scientific, and regulatory concern. PFAS are synthesized by two processes, direct fluorination (e.g., electrochemical fluorination) and oligomerization (e.g., fluorotelomerization). More than a megatonne of PFAS is produced yearly, and thousands of PFAS wind up in end-use products. Atmospheric and aqueous fugitive releases during manufacturing, use, and disposal have resulted in the global distribution of these compounds. Volatile PFAS facilitate long-range transport, commonly followed by complex transformation schemes to recalcitrant terminal PFAS, which do not degrade under environmental conditions and thus migrate through the environment and accumulate in biota through multiple pathways.

GTDB-Tk v2: memory friendly classification with the genome taxonomy database,"Abstract Summary The Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) and associated taxonomic classification toolkit (GTDB-Tk) have been widely adopted by the microbiology community.

Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm and Its Applications: A Systematic Review,"Abstract Throughout the centuries, nature has been a source of inspiration, with much still to learn from and discover about. Among many others, Swarm Intelligence (SI), a substantial branch of Artificial Intelligence, is built on the intelligent collective behavior of social swarms in nature. One of the most popular SI paradigms, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO), is presented in this work. Many changes have been made to PSO since its inception in the mid 1990s. Since their learning about the technique, researchers and practitioners have developed new applications, derived new versions, and published theoretical studies on the potential influence of various parameters and aspects of the algorithm. Various perspectives are surveyed in this paper on existing and ongoing research, including algorithm methods, diverse application domains, open issues, and future perspectives, based on the Systematic Review (SR) process. More specifically, this paper analyzes the existing research on methods and applications published between 2017 and 2019 in a technical taxonomy of the picked content, including hybridization, improvement, and variants of PSO, as well as real-world applications of the algorithm categorized into: health-care, environmental, industrial, commercial, smart city, and general aspects applications. Some technical characteristics, including accuracy, evaluation environments, and proposed case study are involved to investigate the effectiveness of different PSO methods and applications.

Noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms,"A universal fault-tolerant quantum computer that can efficiently solve problems such as integer factorization and unstructured database search requires millions of qubits with low error rates and long coherence times. While the experimental advancement toward realizing such devices will potentially take decades of research, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers already exist. These computers are composed of hundreds of noisy qubits, i.e., qubits that are not error corrected, and therefore perform imperfect operations within a limited coherence time. In the search for achieving quantum advantage with these devices, algorithms have been proposed for applications in various disciplines spanning physics, machine learning, quantum chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. The overarching goal of such algorithms is to leverage the limited available resources to perform classically challenging tasks. In this review, a thorough summary of NISQ computational paradigms and algorithms is provided. The key structure of these algorithms and their limitations and advantages are discussed. Finally, a comprehensive overview of various benchmarking and software tools useful for programming and testing NISQ devices is additionally provided.",2022-02-15,2022,https://doi.org/10.1103/revmodphys.94.015004,1385,4,0.26213880247811816,"['Kishor Bharti', 'Alba Cervera-Lierta', 'Thi Ha Kyaw', 'Tobias Haug', 'Sumner Alperin-Lea', 'Abhinav Anand', 'Matthias Degroote', 'Hermanni Heimonen', 'Jakob S.

Macrophage Polarization States in the Tumor Microenvironment,"The M1/M2 macrophage paradigm plays a key role in tumor progression. M1 macrophages are historically regarded as anti-tumor, while M2-polarized macrophages, commonly deemed tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), are contributors to many pro-tumorigenic outcomes in cancer through angiogenic and lymphangiogenic regulation, immune suppression, hypoxia induction, tumor cell proliferation, and metastasis. The tumor microenvironment (TME) can influence macrophage recruitment and polarization, giving way to these pro-tumorigenic outcomes. Investigating TME-induced macrophage polarization is critical for further understanding of TAM-related pro-tumor outcomes and potential development of new therapeutic approaches. This review explores the current understanding of TME-induced macrophage polarization and the role of M2-polarized macrophages in promoting tumor progression.",2021-06-29,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22136995,1384,3,1.0,"['Ava J.

"Prevalence of autism spectrum disorder among children aged 8 Years - Autism and developmental disabilities monitoring network, 11 Sites, United States, 2014","Problem/Condition: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Period Covered: 2014. Description of System: The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network is an active surveillance system that provides estimates of the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among children aged 8 years whose parents or guardians reside within 11 ADDM sites in the United States (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin). ADDM surveillance is conducted in two phases. The first phase involves review and abstraction of comprehensive evaluations that were completed by professional service providers in the community. Staff completing record review and abstraction receive extensive training and supervision and are evaluated according to strict reliability standards to certify effective initial training, identify ongoing training needs, and ensure adherence to the prescribed methodology. Record review and abstraction occurs in a variety of data sources ranging from general pediatric health clinics to specialized programs serving children with developmental disabilities. In addition, most of the ADDM sites also review records for children who have received special education services in public schools. In the second phase of the study, all abstracted information is reviewed systematically by experienced clinicians to determine ASD case status. A child is considered to meet the surveillance case definition for ASD if he or she displays behaviors, as described on one or more comprehensive evaluations completed by community-based professional providers, consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder; pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS, including atypical autism); or Asperger disorder. This report provides updated ASD prevalence estimates for children aged 8 years during the 2014 surveillance year, on the basis of DSM-IV-TR criteria, and describes characteristics of the population of children with ASD. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association published the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which made considerable changes to ASD diagnostic criteria. The change in ASD diagnostic criteria might influence ADDM ASD prevalence estimates; therefore, most (85%) of the records used to determine prevalence estimates based on DSM-IV-TR criteria underwent additional review under a newly operationalized surveillance case definition for ASD consistent with the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Children meeting this new surveillance case definition could qualify on the basis of one or both of the following criteria, as documented in abstracted comprehensive evaluations: 1) behaviors consistent with the DSM-5 diagnostic features; and/or 2) an ASD diagnosis, whether based on DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Stratified comparisons of the number of children meeting either of these two case definitions also are reported. Results: For 2014, the overall prevalence of ASD among the 11 ADDM sites was 16.8 per 1,000 (one in 59) children aged 8 years. Overall ASD prevalence estimates varied among sites, from 13.1-29.3 per 1,000 children aged 8 years. ASD prevalence estimates also varied by sex and race/ethnicity. Males were four times more likely than females to be identified with ASD. Prevalence estimates were higher for non-Hispanic white (henceforth, white) children compared with non-Hispanic black (henceforth, black) children, and both groups were more likely to be identified with ASD compared with Hispanic children. Among the nine sites with sufficient data on intellectual ability, 31% of children with ASD were classified in the range of intellectual disability (intelligence quotient [IQ] ≤ 70), 25% were in the borderline range (IQ 71-85), and 44% had IQ scores in the average to above average range (i.e., IQ > 85). The distribution of intellectual ability varied by sex and race/ethnicity. Although mention of developmental concerns by age 36 months was documented for 85% of children with ASD, only 42% had a comprehensive evaluation on record by age 36 months. The median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis was 52 months and did not differ significantly by sex or race/ethnicity. For the targeted comparison of DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 results, the number and characteristics of children meeting the newly operationalized DSM-5 case definition for ASD were similar to those meeting the DSM-IV-TR case definition, with DSM-IV-TR case counts exceeding DSM-5 counts by less than 5% and approximately 86% overlap between the two case definitions (kappa = 0.85). Interpretation: Findings from the ADDM Network, on the basis of 2014 data reported from 11 sites, provide updated populationbased estimates of the prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years in multiple communities in the United States. The overall ASD prevalence estimate of 16.8 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in 2014 is higher than previously reported estimates from the ADDM Network. Because the ADDM sites do not provide a representative sample of the entire United States, the combined prevalence estimates presented in this report cannot be generalized to all children aged 8 years in the United States. Consistent with reports from previous ADDM surveillance years, findings from 2014 were marked by variation in ASD prevalence when stratified by geographic area, sex, and level of intellectual ability. Differences in prevalence estimates between black and white children have diminished in most sites, but remained notable for Hispanic children. For 2014, results from application of the DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 case definitions were similar, overall and when stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, DSM-IV-TR diagnostic subtype, or level of intellectual ability. Public Health Action: Beginning with surveillance year 2016, the DSM-5 case definition will serve as the basis for ADDM estimates of ASD prevalence in future surveillance reports. Although the DSM-IV-TR case definition will eventually be phased out, it will be applied in a limited geographic area to offer additional data for comparison. Future analyses will examine trends in the continued use of DSM-IV-TR diagnoses, such as autistic disorder, PDD-NOS, and Asperger disorder in health and education records, documentation of symptoms consistent with DSM-5 terminology, and how these trends might influence estimates of ASD prevalence over time. The latest findings from the ADDM Network provide evidence that the prevalence of ASD is higher than previously reported estimates and continues to vary among certain racial/ethnic groups and communities. With prevalence of ASD ranging from 13.1 to 29.3 per 1,000 children aged 8 years in different communities throughout the United States, the need for behavioral, educational, residential, and occupational services remains high, as does the need for increased research on both genetic and nongenetic risk factors for ASD.",2023-08-17,2023,https://doi.org/10.17615/y3kk-5x30,1381,-1,0.6468411892502048,"['Matthew J.

Changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviours from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: a systematic review,"Objective In March 2020, several countries banned unnecessary outdoor activities during COVID-19, commonly called ‘lockdowns. These lockdowns have the potential to impact associated levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Given the numerous health outcomes associated with physical activity and sedentary behaviour, the aim of this review was to summarise literature that investigated differences in physical activity and sedentary behaviour before vs during the COVID-19 lockdown. Design, data sources and eligibility criteria Electronic databases were searched from November 2019 to October 2020 using terms and synonyms relating to physical activity, sedentary behaviour and COVID-19. The coprimary outcomes were changes in physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour captured via device-based measures or self-report tools. Risk of bias was measured using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results Sixty six articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review (total n=86 981). Changes in physical activity were reported in 64 studies, with the majority of studies reporting decreases in physical activity and increases in sedentary behaviours during their respective lockdowns across several populations, including children and patients with a variety of medical conditions. Conclusion Given the numerous physical and mental benefits of increased physical activity and decreased sedentary behaviour, public health strategies should include the creation and implementation of interventions that promote safe physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour should other lockdowns occur.",2021-01-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsem-2020-000960,1378,-1,0.6850210314170927,"['Stephanie Stockwell', 'Mike Trott', 'Mark A.

Mechanisms of Cellular Senescence: Cell Cycle Arrest and Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype,"Cellular senescence is a stable cell cycle arrest that can be triggered in normal cells in response to various intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, as well as developmental signals. Senescence is considered to be a highly dynamic, multi-step process, during which the properties of senescent cells continuously evolve and diversify in a context dependent manner. It is associated with multiple cellular and molecular changes and distinct phenotypic alterations, including a stable proliferation arrest unresponsive to mitogenic stimuli. Senescent cells remain viable, have alterations in metabolic activity and undergo dramatic changes in gene expression and develop a complex senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Cellular senescence can compromise tissue repair and regeneration, thereby contributing toward aging. Removal of senescent cells can attenuate age-related tissue dysfunction and extend health span. Senescence can also act as a potent anti-tumor mechanism, by preventing proliferation of potentially cancerous cells. It is a cellular program which acts as a double-edged sword, with both beneficial and detrimental effects on the health of the organism, and considered to be an example of evolutionary antagonistic pleiotropy. Activation of the p53/p21 WAF1/CIP1 and p16 INK4A /pRB tumor suppressor pathways play a central role in regulating senescence. Several other pathways have recently been implicated in mediating senescence and the senescent phenotype. Herein we review the molecular mechanisms that underlie cellular senescence and the senescence associated growth arrest with a particular focus on why cells stop dividing, the stability of the growth arrest, the hypersecretory phenotype and how the different pathways are all integrated.",2021-03-29,2021,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.645593,1370,3,0.4938665919692429,"['Ruchi Kumari', 'Parmjit Jat']",,True

"Effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines on covid-19 related symptoms, hospital admissions, and mortality in older adults in England: test negative case-control study","Abstract Objective To estimate the real world effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-S vaccines against confirmed covid-19 symptoms (including the UK variant of concern B.1.1.7), admissions to hospital, and deaths. Design Test negative case-control study. Setting Community testing for covid-19 in England. Participants 156 930 adults aged 70 years and older who reported symptoms of covid-19 between 8 December 2020 and 19 February 2021 and were successfully linked to vaccination data in the National Immunisation Management System. Interventions Vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S. Main outcome measures Primary outcomes were polymerase chain reaction confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, admissions to hospital for covid-19, and deaths with covid-19. Results Participants aged 80 years and older vaccinated with BNT162b2 before 4 January 2021 had a higher odds of testing positive for covid-19 in the first nine days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore compared with the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted 10 to 13 days after vaccination, reaching a vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% confidence interval 59% to 78%), then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccination effectiveness of 89% (85% to 93%) was found compared with the increased baseline risk. Participants aged 70 years and older vaccinated from 4 January (when ChAdOx1-S delivery commenced) had a similar underlying risk of covid-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (51% to 69%) from 28 to 34 days after vaccination, then plateaued. With ChAdOx1-S, effects were seen from 14 to 20 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 60% (41% to 73%) from 28 to 34 days, increasing to 73% (27% to 90%) from day 35 onwards. On top of the protection against symptomatic disease, a further 43% (33% to 52%) reduced risk of emergency hospital admission and 51% (37% to 62%) reduced risk of death was observed in those who had received one dose of BNT162b2. Participants who had received one dose of ChAdOx1-S had a further 37% (3% to 59%) reduced risk of emergency hospital admission. Follow-up was insufficient to assess the effect of ChAdOx1-S on mortality. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, a single dose of either vaccine was about 80% effective at preventing admission to hospital with covid-19 and a single dose of BNT162b2 was 85% effective at preventing death with covid-19. Conclusion Vaccination with either one dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic covid-19 in older adults, and with further protection against severe disease. Both vaccines showed similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up (&gt;6 weeks). A second dose of BNT162b2 was associated with further protection against symptomatic disease.

De novo design of protein structure and function with RFdiffusion,"Abstract There has been considerable recent progress in designing new proteins using deep-learning methods 1–9 . Despite this progress, a general deep-learning framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher-order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models 10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence–structure relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.",2023-07-11,2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06415-8,1366,5,0.44429690492520907,"['Joseph L.

Revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's Association Workgroup,"Abstract The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association convened three separate work groups in 2011 and single work groups in 2012 and 2018 to create recommendations for the diagnosis and characterization of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present document updates the 2018 research framework in response to several recent developments. Defining diseases biologically, rather than based on syndromic presentation, has long been standard in many areas of medicine (e.g., oncology), and is becoming a unifying concept common to all neurodegenerative diseases, not just AD. The present document is consistent with this principle. Our intent is to present objective criteria for diagnosis and staging AD, incorporating recent advances in biomarkers, to serve as a bridge between research and clinical care. These criteria are not intended to provide step‐by‐step clinical practice guidelines for clinical workflow or specific treatment protocols, but rather serve as general principles to inform diagnosis and staging of AD that reflect current science. Highlights We define Alzheimer's disease (AD) to be a biological process that begins with the appearance of AD neuropathologic change (ADNPC) while people are asymptomatic. Progression of the neuropathologic burden leads to the later appearance and progression of clinical symptoms. Early‐changing Core 1 biomarkers (amyloid positron emission tomography [PET], approved cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and accurate plasma biomarkers [especially phosphorylated tau 217]) map onto either the amyloid beta or AD tauopathy pathway; however, these reflect the presence of ADNPC more generally (i.e., both neuritic plaques and tangles). An abnormal Core 1 biomarker result is sufficient to establish a diagnosis of AD and to inform clinical decision making throughout the disease continuum. Later‐changing Core 2 biomarkers (biofluid and tau PET) can provide prognostic information, and when abnormal, will increase confidence that AD is contributing to symptoms. An integrated biological and clinical staging scheme is described that accommodates the fact that common copathologies, cognitive reserve, and resistance may modify relationships between clinical and biological AD stages.",2024-06-27,2024,https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.13859,1366,1,1.0,"['Clifford R.

Fecal microbiota transplant overcomes resistance to anti–PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients,"New fecal microbiota for cancer patients The composition of the gut microbiome influences the response of cancer patients to immunotherapies. Baruch et al. and Davar et al. report first-in-human clinical trials to test whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can affect how metastatic melanoma patients respond to anti–PD-1 immunotherapy (see the Perspective by Woelk and Snyder). Both studies observed evidence of clinical benefit in a subset of treated patients. This included increased abundance of taxa previously shown to be associated with response to anti–PD-1, increased CD8 + T cell activation, and decreased frequency of interleukin-8–expressing myeloid cells, which are involved in immunosuppression.

Here, we describe a deep learning–based protein sequence design method, ProteinMPNN, that has outstanding performance in both in silico and experimental tests. On native protein backbones, ProteinMPNN has a sequence recovery of 52.4% compared with 32.9% for Rosetta. The amino acid sequence at different positions can be coupled between single or multiple chains, enabling application to a wide range of current protein design challenges.

Rechargeable Batteries for Grid Scale Energy Storage,"Ever-increasing global energy consumption has driven the development of renewable energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) with high electrochemical performance are critical for enabling renewable yet intermittent sources of energy such as solar and wind. In recent years, numerous new battery technologies have been achieved and showed great potential for grid scale energy storage (GSES) applications. However, their practical applications have been greatly impeded due to the gap between the breakthroughs achieved in research laboratories and the industrial applications. In addition, various complex applications call for different battery performances. Matching of diverse batteries to various applications is required to promote practical energy storage research achievement. This review provides in-depth discussion and comprehensive consideration in the battery research field for GSES. The overall requirements of battery technologies for practical applications with key parameters are systematically analyzed by generating standards and measures for GSES. We also discuss recent progress and existing challenges for some representative battery technologies with great promise for GSES, including metal-ion batteries, lead-acid batteries, molten-salt batteries, alkaline batteries, redox-flow batteries, metal-air batteries, and hydrogen-gas batteries. Moreover, we emphasize the importance of bringing emerging battery technologies from academia to industry.

Quality Control of Ceramic Wall Products Six Sigma Method with Dmaic Tools and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA),"Considering the importance of increasingly rapid industrial development, business people must be aware of the orientation towards product quality. The manufacturing industry has an important role in industrial development. It is hoped that it will be able to grow and have advantages in industrial development, therefore it is necessary to improve and increase product quality. The company continues to strive to maintain and improve product quality and increase productivity so that customers are satisfied with the products produced. One way that needs to be done is to reduce the number of defective products in the production process. This effort is one way of continuous improvement carried out by PT. ABC and companies operating in the same field. The ceramic wall production process has relatively high demand but still has a high level of defects. Based on information on production data and data on the number of defects for the period January – September 2023, wall ceramic production has a defect rate of 3.86%. Companies must reduce the number of defects to achieve company targets. This research aims to improve the production process of wall ceramics by minimizing the number of defective products. This research uses the six sigma method with the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) tool assisted by the FMEA (Failure Mode and Analysis) method. Corrective action to reduce defects based on the 5 Why analysis is to find out what the problem is and ask ""why"" and ""what is the root of the problem"". The research results show that there are 4 types of defects which have a large number of defects, namely Rupture Defects, Application Defects, Peeling Defects and Hole Defects. From the research results, solutions were obtained for the emergence of several types of defects in the wall ceramic production process, namely by providing planning suggestions and corrective actions which are discussed this time. At the defect calculation stage, Broken produces a DPMO value of 29.362 with a sigma level of 3.39 with a sigma level of 3.48, Defect Peeled produces a DPMO value of 28.044 with a sigma level of 3.38, and holes are defective. resulting in a DPMO value of 26,020 with a sigma value of 3.45 from the data calculation results, it is still not enough to meet the company's target at the sigma level, therefore the company must make quality improvements to achieve the main target at the sigma level.",2024-06-27,2024,https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jun1035,1359,0,1.0,"['Muhammad Rizki', 'Tri Ngudi Wiyatno', 'Retno Fitri Astuti']",,True

Controlled Drug Delivery Systems: Current Status and Future Directions,"The drug delivery system enables the release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to achieve a desired therapeutic response. Conventional drug delivery systems (tablets, capsules, syrups, ointments, etc.) suffer from poor bioavailability and fluctuations in plasma drug level and are unable to achieve sustained release. Without an efficient delivery mechanism, the whole therapeutic process can be rendered useless. Moreover, the drug has to be delivered at a specified controlled rate and at the target site as precisely as possible to achieve maximum efficacy and safety. Controlled drug delivery systems are developed to combat the problems associated with conventional drug delivery. There has been a tremendous evolution in controlled drug delivery systems from the past two decades ranging from macro scale and nano scale to intelligent targeted delivery. The initial part of this review provides a basic understanding of drug delivery systems with an emphasis on the pharmacokinetics of the drug. It also discusses the conventional drug delivery systems and their limitations. Further, controlled drug delivery systems are discussed in detail with the design considerations, classifications and drawings.

"Nanoparticle classification, physicochemical properties, characterization, and applications: a comprehensive review for biologists","Abstract Interest in nanomaterials and especially nanoparticles has exploded in the past decades primarily due to their novel or enhanced physical and chemical properties compared to bulk material. These extraordinary properties have created a multitude of innovative applications in the fields of medicine and pharma, electronics, agriculture, chemical catalysis, food industry, and many others. More recently, nanoparticles are also being synthesized ‘biologically’ through the use of plant- or microorganism-mediated processes, as an environmentally friendly alternative to the expensive, energy-intensive, and potentially toxic physical and chemical synthesis methods. This transdisciplinary approach to nanoparticle synthesis requires that biologists and biotechnologists understand and learn to use the complex methodology needed to properly characterize these processes. This review targets a bio-oriented audience and summarizes the physico–chemical properties of nanoparticles, and methods used for their characterization. It highlights why nanomaterials are different compared to micro- or bulk materials. We try to provide a comprehensive overview of the different classes of nanoparticles and their novel or enhanced physicochemical properties including mechanical, thermal, magnetic, electronic, optical, and catalytic properties. A comprehensive list of the common methods and techniques used for the characterization and analysis of these properties is presented together with a large list of examples for biogenic nanoparticles that have been previously synthesized and characterized, including their application in the fields of medicine, electronics, agriculture, and food production.

"CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain<b>—</b>United States, 2022","This guideline provides recommendations for clinicians providing pain care, including those prescribing opioids, for outpatients aged ≥18 years. It updates the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain - United States, 2016 (MMWR Recomm Rep 2016;65[No. RR-1]:1-49) and includes recommendations for managing acute (duration of <1 month), subacute (duration of 1-3 months), and chronic (duration of >3 months) pain. The recommendations do not apply to pain related to sickle cell disease or cancer or to patients receiving palliative or end-of-life care. The guideline addresses the following four areas: 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain, 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages, 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up, and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. CDC developed the guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Recommendations are based on systematic reviews of the scientific evidence and reflect considerations of benefits and harms, patient and clinician values and preferences, and resource allocation. CDC obtained input from the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (a federally chartered advisory committee), the public, and peer reviewers. CDC recommends that persons with pain receive appropriate pain treatment, with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options in the context of the patient's circumstances. Recommendations should not be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations. This clinical practice guideline is intended to improve communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of pain treatments, including opioid therapy; improve the effectiveness and safety of pain treatment; mitigate pain; improve function and quality of life for patients with pain; and reduce risks associated with opioid pain therapy, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death.",2022-11-03,2022,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.rr7103a1,1353,1,1.0,"['Deborah Dowell', 'Kathleen Ragan', 'Christopher M.

Behavioral Game Theory,"People deviate from the predictions of game theory in two systematic ways. They are not purely self-interested (they care about fairness and try to cooperate with others), and they do not always consider what other players will do before making choices. However, with experience, these deviations sometimes disappear. People learn when they can afford to be unfair and what others will do; their behavior often converges to a game-theoretic equilibrium.

What if the devil is my guardian angel: ChatGPT as a case study of using chatbots in education,"Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been progressing constantly and being more visible in different aspects of our lives. One recent phenomenon is ChatGPT, a chatbot with a conversational artificial intelligence interface that was developed by OpenAI. As one of the most advanced artificial intelligence applications, ChatGPT has drawn much public attention across the globe. In this regard, this study examines ChatGPT in education, among early adopters, through a qualitative instrumental case study. Conducted in three stages, the first stage of the study reveals that the public discourse in social media is generally positive and there is enthusiasm regarding its use in educational settings. However, there are also voices who are approaching cautiously using ChatGPT in educational settings. The second stage of the study examines the case of ChatGPT through lenses of educational transformation, response quality, usefulness, personality and emotion, and ethics. In the third and final stage of the study, the investigation of user experiences through ten educational scenarios revealed various issues, including cheating, honesty and truthfulness of ChatGPT, privacy misleading, and manipulation. The findings of this study provide several research directions that should be considered to ensure a safe and responsible adoption of chatbots, specifically ChatGPT, in education.",2023-02-22,2023,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40561-023-00237-x,1345,2,1.0,"['Ahmed Tlili', 'Boulus Shehata', 'Michael Agyemang Adarkwah', 'Aras Bozkurt', 'Daniel T.

Mip-NeRF 360: Unbounded Anti-Aliased Neural Radiance Fields,"Though neural radiance fields (NeRF) have demon-strated impressive view synthesis results on objects and small bounded regions of space, they struggle on “un-bounded” scenes, where the camera may point in any di-rection and content may exist at any distance. In this set-ting, existing NeRF-like models often produce blurry or low-resolution renderings (due to the unbalanced detail and scale of nearby and distant objects), are slow to train, and may exhibit artifacts due to the inherent ambiguity of the task of reconstructing a large scene from a small set of images. We present an extension of mip-NeRF (a NeRF variant that addresses sampling and aliasing) that uses a non-linear scene parameterization, online distillation, and a novel distortion-based regularizer to overcome the chal-lenges presented by unbounded scenes. Our model, which we dub “mip-NeRF 360” as we target scenes in which the camera rotates 360 degrees around a point, reduces mean-squared error by 57% compared to mip-NeRF, and is able to produce realistic synthesized views and detailed depth maps for highly intricate, unbounded real-world scenes.",2022-06-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr52688.2022.00539,1337,0,0.626450335272725,"['Jonathan T.

Metal–Organic Framework-Based Hierarchically Porous Materials: Synthesis and Applications,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely recognized as one of the most fascinating classes of materials from science and engineering perspectives, benefiting from their high porosity and well-defined and tailored structures and components at the atomic level. Although their intrinsic micropores endow size-selective capability and high surface area, etc., the narrow pores limit their applications toward diffusion-control and large-size species involved processes. In recent years, the construction of hierarchically porous MOFs (HP-MOFs), MOF-based hierarchically porous composites, and MOF-based hierarchically porous derivatives has captured widespread interest to extend the applications of conventional MOF-based materials. In this Review, the recent advances in the design, synthesis, and functional applications of MOF-based hierarchically porous materials are summarized. Their structural characters toward various applications, including catalysis, gas storage and separation, air filtration, sewage treatment, sensing and energy storage, have been demonstrated with typical reports.

A Survey of Large Language Models,"Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.",2023-03-31,2023,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2303.18223,1336,0,0.8008895899510365,"['Wayne Xin Zhao', 'Kun Zhou', 'Junyi Li', 'Tianyi Tang', 'Xiaolei Wang', 'Yupeng Hou', 'Yingqian Min', 'Beichen Zhang', 'Junjie Zhang', 'Zican Dong', 'Yifan Du', 'Yang Chen', 'Yushuo Chen', 'Zhipeng Chen', 'Jinhao Jiang', 'Ruiyang Ren', 'Yifan Li', 'Xinyu Tang', 'Zikang Liu', 'Peiyu Liu', 'Jian‐Yun Nie', 'Ji-Rong Wen']",,True
INTRODUCTORY STATISTICS,"There are numerous probability distributions or density functions. Empirical distributions rarely go by the name of densities. The normal density has figured prominent in the history of statistics largely because it serves as a useful model for many phenomena, and also because it provides a very convenient starting point for much work in theoretical statistics. The chi-square distribution plays an important role in mathematical statistics and is associated with a number of tests on model coefficients in a variety of statistical methods. The chi-square goodness-of-fit test is one such statistical method that utilizes the chi-square test statistic to evaluate the tenability of a null hypothesis. The goal of statistical inference is, in general, to estimate parameters of a population.

SCORE2 risk prediction algorithms: new models to estimate 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease in Europe,"Abstract Aims The aim of this study was to develop, validate, and illustrate an updated prediction model (SCORE2) to estimate 10-year fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in individuals without previous CVD or diabetes aged 40–69 years in Europe. Methods and results We derived risk prediction models using individual-participant data from 45 cohorts in 13 countries (677 684 individuals, 30 121 CVD events). We used sex-specific and competing risk-adjusted models, including age, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and total- and HDL-cholesterol. We defined four risk regions in Europe according to country-specific CVD mortality, recalibrating models to each region using expected incidences and risk factor distributions. Region-specific incidence was estimated using CVD mortality and incidence data on 10 776 466 individuals. For external validation, we analysed data from 25 additional cohorts in 15 European countries (1 133 181 individuals, 43 492 CVD events). After applying the derived risk prediction models to external validation cohorts, C-indices ranged from 0.67 (0.65–0.68) to 0.81 (0.76–0.86). Predicted CVD risk varied several-fold across European regions. For example, the estimated 10-year CVD risk for a 50-year-old smoker, with a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg, total cholesterol of 5.5 mmol/L, and HDL-cholesterol of 1.3 mmol/L, ranged from 5.9% for men in low-risk countries to 14.0% for men in very high-risk countries, and from 4.2% for women in low-risk countries to 13.7% for women in very high-risk countries. Conclusion SCORE2—a new algorithm derived, calibrated, and validated to predict 10-year risk of first-onset CVD in European populations—enhances the identification of individuals at higher risk of developing CVD across Europe.",2021-05-05,2021,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab309,1332,1,0.5065267022406087,"['Steven H J Hageman', 'Lisa Pennells', 'Francisco Ojeda', 'Stephen Kaptoge', 'Kari Kuulasmaa', 'Tamar I. de Vries', 'Zhe Xu', 'Frank Kee', 'Ryan Chung', 'Angela Wood', 'John W.

Gut microbiota composition reflects disease severity and dysfunctional immune responses in patients with COVID-19,"Objective Although COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness, there is mounting evidence suggesting that the GI tract is involved in this disease. We investigated whether the gut microbiome is linked to disease severity in patients with COVID-19, and whether perturbations in microbiome composition, if any, resolve with clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Methods In this two-hospital cohort study, we obtained blood, stool and patient records from 100 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serial stool samples were collected from 27 of the 100 patients up to 30 days after clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Gut microbiome compositions were characterised by shotgun sequencing total DNA extracted from stools. Concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and blood markers were measured from plasma. Results Gut microbiome composition was significantly altered in patients with COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-19 individuals irrespective of whether patients had received medication (p&lt;0.01). Several gut commensals with known immunomodulatory potential such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii , Eubacterium rectale and bifidobacteria were underrepresented in patients and remained low in samples collected up to 30 days after disease resolution. Moreover, this perturbed composition exhibited stratification with disease severity concordant with elevated concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and blood markers such as C reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Conclusion Associations between gut microbiota composition, levels of cytokines and inflammatory markers in patients with COVID-19 suggest that the gut microbiome is involved in the magnitude of COVID-19 severity possibly via modulating host immune responses. Furthermore, the gut microbiota dysbiosis after disease resolution could contribute to persistent symptoms, highlighting a need to understand how gut microorganisms are involved in inflammation and COVID-19.",2021-01-11,2021,https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2020-323020,1331,-1,0.11572780467737327,"['Yun Kit Yeoh', 'Tao Zuo', 'Grace Lui', 'Fen Zhang', 'Qin Liu', 'Amy Y.

The role of ROS in tumour development and progression,"Eukaryotic cells have developed complex systems to regulate the production and response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Different ROS control diverse aspects of cell behaviour from signalling to death, and deregulation of ROS production and ROS limitation pathways are common features of cancer cells. ROS also function to modulate the tumour environment, affecting the various stromal cells that provide metabolic support, a blood supply and immune responses to the tumour. Although it is clear that ROS play important roles during tumorigenesis, it has been difficult to reliably predict the effect of ROS modulating therapies. We now understand that the responses to ROS are highly complex and dependent on multiple factors, including the types, levels, localization and persistence of ROS, as well as the origin, environment and stage of the tumours themselves. This increasing understanding of the complexity of ROS in malignancies will be key to unlocking the potential of ROS-targeting therapies for cancer treatment.",2022-01-31,2022,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41568-021-00435-0,1331,3,0.4979390337173541,"['Eric C.

Neuromodulatory Control Networks (NCNs): A Biologically Inspired Architecture for Dynamic LLM Processing,"Large Language Models (LLMs) based on the Transformer architecture have achieved remarkable success, yet their core processing mechanisms remain largely static after training. While powerful, this static nature limits their ability to dynamically adapt their processing strategy based on nuanced contextual cues, task demands, or desired operational modes (e.g., shifting between exploration and exploitation). We propose Neuromodulatory Control Networks (NCNs), a novel architectural modification inspired by the neuromodulatory systems in the vertebrate brain (e.g., those utilizing dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine). NCNs are small, parallel networks that receive contextual input, summarizing the global state, task information, or external control signals, and compute dynamic ""modulatory signals"". These signals are distributed as layer-specific control vectors to the main LLM to influence its computational properties during a forward pass, analogous to how neuromodulators alter neuronal gain, plasticity, and network states across different cortical depths. Instead of merely routing information, NCNs aim to change how information is processed throughout the base model by modulating key components like attention mechanisms (e.g., via precision scaling), layer gains, and activation functions. Crucially, the architecture allows the model to implicitly learn to self-regulate these parameters via backpropagation, effectively becoming its own ""tuning expert."" We further introduce formal stability mechanisms, including homeostatic regularization, to prevent control manifold collapse. This paper introduces the NCN architecture, details its components and implicit learning mechanism, discusses its conceptual advantages and potential failure modes (such as contextual stereotyping), and provides an open-source PyTorch implementation to facilitate community exploration and future empirical validation.",2025-04-25,2025,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17822766,1324,0,0.3410680777183725,"['Jimmy Ba', 'Jamie Kiros', 'Geoffrey E.

This approach involves integrating various machine learning models as a basic model, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). A stacking ensemble framework is then used to combine the predictions of these base models using a meta model namely Logistic Regression (LR). The results show a significant improvement in both transformers using stacking-GA, both TR-A and TR-B, with each prediction evaluation 99% and with a minimal error rate, namely approaching 0.the developed framework presents a promising solution for accurate and reliable transformer life prediction.

"Ultrafast one‐pass FASTQ data preprocessing, quality control, and deduplication using fastp","Abstract A large amount of sequencing data is generated and processed every day with the continuous evolution of sequencing technology and the expansion of sequencing applications. One consequence of such sequencing data explosion is the increasing cost and complexity of data processing. The preprocessing of FASTQ data, which means removing adapter contamination, filtering low‐quality reads, and correcting wrongly represented bases, is an indispensable but resource intensive part of sequencing data analysis. Therefore, although a lot of software applications have been developed to solve this problem, bioinformatics scientists and engineers are still pursuing faster, simpler, and more energy‐efficient software. Several years ago, the author developed fastp, which is an ultrafast all‐in‐one FASTQ data preprocessor with many modern features. This software has been approved by many bioinformatics users and has been continuously maintained and updated. Since the first publication on fastp, it has been greatly improved, making it even faster and more powerful.

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on utilisation of healthcare services: a systematic review,"Objectives To determine the extent and nature of changes in utilisation of healthcare services during COVID-19 pandemic. Design Systematic review. Eligibility Eligible studies compared utilisation of services during COVID-19 pandemic to at least one comparable period in prior years. Services included visits, admissions, diagnostics and therapeutics. Studies were excluded if from single centres or studied only patients with COVID-19. Data sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and preprints were searched, without language restrictions, until 10 August, using detailed searches with key concepts including COVID-19, health services and impact. Data analysis Risk of bias was assessed by adapting the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool, and a Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care tool. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics, graphical figures and narrative synthesis. Outcome measures Primary outcome was change in service utilisation between prepandemic and pandemic periods. Secondary outcome was the change in proportions of users of healthcare services with milder or more severe illness (eg, triage scores). Results 3097 unique references were identified, and 81 studies across 20 countries included, reporting on &gt;11 million services prepandemic and 6.9 million during pandemic. For the primary outcome, there were 143 estimates of changes, with a median 37% reduction in services overall (IQR −51% to −20%), comprising median reductions for visits of 42% (−53% to −32%), admissions 28% (−40% to −17%), diagnostics 31% (−53% to −24%) and for therapeutics 30% (−57% to −19%). Among 35 studies reporting secondary outcomes, there were 60 estimates, with 27 (45%) reporting larger reductions in utilisation among people with a milder spectrum of illness, and 33 (55%) reporting no difference. Conclusions Healthcare utilisation decreased by about a third during the pandemic, with considerable variation, and with greater reductions among people with less severe illness. While addressing unmet need remains a priority, studies of health impacts of reductions may help health systems reduce unnecessary care in the postpandemic recovery.

Access to the Internal Lexicon,"In order to understand how a word is read for meaning, we need to know how a reader proceeds from the printed representation of a word to the word's entry in the reader's internal lexicon, where the word's meaning is stored. This raises two principal questions: what is the code in which the word is represented when this process, lexical access, is being carried out, and what is the procedure by which this representation is used to find the word's entry in the lexicon. The lexical-decision task is a suitable one for the investigation of these questions. Two experiments using this task are reported. In one, it was found that a letter string's similarity to English words influenced the ""no"" response latency, but not the ""yes"" response latency, and it is argued that this result favors the view that lexical access is ""direct,"" rather than requiring search. The other experiment showed that a nonword's phonological properties influenced the time taken to say ""no"" to it. Thus phonological encoding is occurring in these experiments. It remains to be shown, however, that this is any more than an epiphenomenon; neither these findings, nor those of previous investigators, compel us to abandon the view that skilled reading of single words proceeds solely by making use of visual representations of printed words.",2022-05-19,2022,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003309734-29,1309,-1,0.18740883441849976,"['Max Coltheart', 'Eileen Davelaar', 'Jón Torfi Jónasson', 'Derek Besner']",,False

Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture and Its Mitigation Strategies: A Review,"Climate change is a global threat to the food and nutritional security of the world. As greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere are increasing, the temperature is also rising due to the greenhouse effect. The average global temperature is increasing continuously and is predicted to rise by 2 °C until 2100, which would cause substantial economic losses at the global level. The concentration of CO2, which accounts for a major proportion of greenhouse gases, is increasing at an alarming rate, and has led to higher growth and plant productivity due to increased photosynthesis, but increased temperature offsets this effect as it leads to increased crop respiration rate and evapotranspiration, higher pest infestation, a shift in weed flora, and reduced crop duration. Climate change also affects the microbial population and their enzymatic activities in soil. This paper reviews the information collected through the literature regarding the issue of climate change, its possible causes, its projection in the near future, its impact on the agriculture sector as an influence on physiological and metabolic activities of plants, and its potential and reported implications for growth and plant productivity, pest infestation, and mitigation strategies and their economic impact.",2021-01-27,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13031318,1309,-1,0.30624448959487943,"['Gurdeep Singh Malhi', 'Manpreet Kaur', 'Prashant Kaushik']",,True
New approaches and procedures for cancer treatment: Current perspectives,"Cancer is a global health problem responsible for one in six deaths worldwide. Treating cancer has been a highly complex process. Conventional treatment approaches, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, have been in use, while significant advances are being made in recent times, including stem cell therapy, targeted therapy, ablation therapy, nanoparticles, natural antioxidants, radionics, chemodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy, and ferroptosis-based therapy. Current methods in oncology focus on the development of safe and efficient cancer nanomedicines. Stem cell therapy has brought promising efficacy in regenerating and repairing diseased or damaged tissues by targeting both primary and metastatic cancer foci, and nanoparticles brought new diagnostic and therapeutic options. Targeted therapy possessed breakthrough potential inhibiting the growth and spread of specific cancer cells, causing less damage to healthy cells. Ablation therapy has emerged as a minimally invasive procedure that burns or freezes cancers without the need for open surgery. Natural antioxidants demonstrated potential tracking down free radicals and neutralizing their harmful effects thereby treating or preventing cancer.

Language and culture,"This paper surveys the research methods and approaches used in the multidisciplinary field of applied language studies or language education over the last fourty years. Drawing on insights gained in psycho- and sociolinguistics, educational linguistics and linguistic anthropology with regard to language and culture, it is organized around five major questions that concern language educators. The first is: How is cultural meaning encoded in the linguistic sign? It discusses how the use of a symbolic system affects thought, how speakers of different languages think differently when speaking, and how speakers of different discourses (across language or in the same language) have different cultural worldviews. The second question is: How is cultural meaning expressed pragmatically through verbal action? It discusses the realization of speech acts across cultures, culturally-inflected conversation analysis, and the use of cultural frames. The third question is: How is culture co-constructed by participants in interaction? It discusses how applied linguistics has moved from a structuralist to a constructivist view of language and culture, from performance to performativity, and from a focus on culture to a focus on historicity and subjectivity. The fourth question is: How is research on language and culture affected by language technologies? The print culture of the book, the virtual culture of the Internet, the online culture of electronic exchanges all have their own ways of redrawing the boundaries of what may be said, written and done within a given discourse community. They are inextricably linked to issues of power and control.

An Empirical Study of Training Self-Supervised Vision Transformers,"This paper does not describe a novel method. Instead, it studies a straightforward, incremental, yet must-know baseline given the recent progress in computer vision: self-supervised learning for Vision Transformers (ViT). While the training recipes for standard convolutional networks have been highly mature and robust, the recipes for ViT are yet to be built, especially in the self-supervised scenarios where training becomes more challenging. In this work, we go back to basics and investigate the effects of several fundamental components for training self-supervised ViT. We observe that instability is a major issue that degrades accuracy, and it can be hidden by apparently good results. We reveal that these results are indeed partial failure, and they can be improved when training is made more stable. We benchmark ViT results in MoCo v3 and several other self-supervised frameworks, with ablations in various aspects.

Palette: Image-to-Image Diffusion Models,"This paper develops a unified framework for image-to-image translation based on conditional diffusion models and evaluates this framework on four challenging image-to-image translation tasks, namely colorization, inpainting, uncropping, and JPEG restoration.

We uncover the impact of an L2 vs. L1 loss in the denoising diffusion objective on sample diversity, and demonstrate the importance of self-attention in the neural architecture through empirical studies. Importantly, we advocate a unified evaluation protocol based on ImageNet, with human evaluation and sample quality scores (FID, Inception Score, Classification Accuracy of a pre-trained ResNet-50, and Perceptual Distance against original images). We expect this standardized evaluation protocol to play a role in advancing image-to-image translation research.

Autoformer: Decomposition Transformers with Auto-Correlation for\n Long-Term Series Forecasting,"Extending the forecasting time is a critical demand for real applications,\nsuch as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption\nplanning. This paper studies the long-term forecasting problem of time series.\nPrior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to\ndiscover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns of\nthe long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies.\nAlso, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise\nself-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information\nutilization bottleneck. Going beyond Transformers, we design Autoformer as a\nnovel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break\nwith the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a\nbasic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with\nprogressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired\nby the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism\nbased on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and\nrepresentation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation\noutperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term\nforecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative\nimprovement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy,\ntraffic, economics, weather and disease.

WavLM: Large-Scale Self-Supervised Pre-Training for Full Stack Speech Processing,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) achieves great success in speech recognition,\nwhile limited exploration has been attempted for other speech processing tasks.\nAs speech signal contains multi-faceted information including speaker identity,\nparalinguistics, spoken content, etc., learning universal representations for\nall speech tasks is challenging. To tackle the problem, we propose a new\npre-trained model, WavLM, to solve full-stack downstream speech tasks. WavLM\njointly learns masked speech prediction and denoising in pre-training. By this\nmeans, WavLM does not only keep the speech content modeling capability by the\nmasked speech prediction, but also improves the potential to non-ASR tasks by\nthe speech denoising.

Psychological characteristics associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and resistance in Ireland and the United Kingdom,"Abstract Identifying and understanding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy within distinct populations may aid future public health messaging. Using nationally representative data from the general adult populations of Ireland ( N = 1041) and the United Kingdom (UK; N = 2025), we found that vaccine hesitancy/resistance was evident for 35% and 31% of these populations respectively. Vaccine hesitant/resistant respondents in Ireland and the UK differed on a number of sociodemographic and health-related variables but were similar across a broad array of psychological constructs. In both populations, those resistant to a COVID-19 vaccine were less likely to obtain information about the pandemic from traditional and authoritative sources and had similar levels of mistrust in these sources compared to vaccine accepting respondents. Given the geographical proximity and socio-economic similarity of the populations studied, it is not possible to generalize findings to other populations, however, the methodology employed here may be useful to those wishing to understand COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy elsewhere.",2021-01-04,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20226-9,1301,1,0.46155987486534594,"['Jamie Murphy', 'Frédérique Vallières', 'Richard P.

The Road Towards 6G: A Comprehensive Survey,"As of today, the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication system has been\nrolled out in many countries and the number of 5G subscribers already reaches a\nvery large scale. It is time for academia and industry to shift their attention\ntowards the next generation. At this crossroad, an overview of the current\nstate of the art and a vision of future communications are definitely of\ninterest. This article thus aims to provide a comprehensive survey to draw a\npicture of the sixth generation (6G) system in terms of drivers, use cases,\nusage scenarios, requirements, key performance indicators (KPIs), architecture,\nand enabling technologies. First, we attempt to answer the question of ""Is\nthere any need for 6G?"" by shedding light on its key driving factors, in which\nwe predict the explosive growth of mobile traffic until 2030, and envision\npotential use cases and usage scenarios. Second, the technical requirements of\n6G are discussed and compared with those of 5G with respect to a set of KPIs in\na quantitative manner. Third, the state-of-the-art 6G research efforts and\nactivities from representative institutions and countries are summarized, and a\ntentative roadmap of definition, specification, standardization, and regulation\nis projected. Then, we identify a dozen of potential technologies and introduce\ntheir principles, advantages, challenges, and open research issues. Finally,\nthe conclusions are drawn to paint a picture of ""What 6G may look like?"".

Root-mean-square error (RMSE) or mean absolute error (MAE): when to use them or not,"Abstract. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are widely used metrics for evaluating models. Yet, there remains enduring confusion over their use, such that a standard practice is to present both, leaving it to the reader to decide which is more relevant. In a recent reprise to the 200-year debate over their use, Willmott and Matsuura (2005) and Chai and Draxler (2014) give arguments for favoring one metric or the other. However, this comparison can present a false dichotomy. Neither metric is inherently better: RMSE is optimal for normal (Gaussian) errors, and MAE is optimal for Laplacian errors. When errors deviate from these distributions, other metrics are superior.",2022-07-19,2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5481-2022,1295,2,0.5784000195809482,['Timothy Hodson'],,True

Sparse R-CNN: End-to-End Object Detection with Learnable Proposals,"We present Sparse R-CNN, a purely sparse method for object detection in images. Existing works on object detection heavily rely on dense object candidates, such as k anchor boxes pre-defined on all grids of image feature map of size H × W. In our method, however, a fixed sparse set of learned object proposals, total length of N, are provided to object recognition head to perform classification and location. By eliminating HWk (up to hundreds of thousands) hand-designed object candidates to N (e.g. 100) learnable proposals, Sparse R-CNN completely avoids all efforts related to object candidates design and many-to-one label assignment. More importantly, final predictions are directly output without non-maximum suppression post-procedure. Sparse R-CNN demonstrates accuracy, run-time and training convergence performance on par with the well-established detector baselines on the challenging COCO dataset, e.g., achieving 45.0 AP in standard 3× training schedule and running at 22 fps using ResNet-50 FPN model.

The Lancet Global Health Commission on Global Eye Health: vision beyond 2020,"Eye health and vision have widespread and profound implications for many aspects of life, health, sustainable development, and the economy. Yet nowadays, many people, families, and populations continue to suffer the consequences of poor access to high-quality, affordable eye care, leading to vision impairment and blindness. In 2020, an estimated 596 million people had distance vision impairment worldwide, of whom 43 million were blind. Another 510 million people had uncorrected near vision impairment, simply because of not having reading spectacles. A large proportion of those affected (90%), live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, encouragingly, more than 90% of people with vision impairment have a preventable or treatable cause with existing highly cost-effective interventions. Eye conditions affect all stages of life, with young children and older people being particularly affected. Crucially, women, rural populations, and ethnic minority groups are more likely to have vision impairment, and this pervasive inequality needs to be addressed. By 2050, population ageing, growth, and urbanisation might lead to an estimated 895 million people with distance vision impairment, of whom 61 million will be blind. Action to prioritise eye health is needed now. This Commission defines eye health as maximised vision, ocular health, and functional ability, thereby contributing to overall health and wellbeing, social inclusion, and quality of life. Eye health is essential to achieve many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Poor eye health and impaired vision have a negative effect on quality of life and restrict equitable access to and achievement in education and the workplace. Vision loss has substantial financial implications for affected individuals, families, and communities. Although high-quality data for global economic estimates are scarce, particularly for LMICs, conservative assessments based on the latest prevalence figures for 2020 suggest that annual global productivity loss from vision impairment is approximately US$410·7 billion purchasing power parity. Vision impairment reduces mobility, affects mental wellbeing, exacerbates risk of dementia, increases likelihood of falls and road traffic crashes, increases the need for social care, and ultimately leads to higher mortality rates. By contrast, vision facilitates many daily life activities, enables better educational outcomes, and increases work productivity, reducing inequality. An increasing amount of evidence shows the potential for vision to advance the SDGs, by contributing towards poverty reduction, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education, gender equality, and decent work. Eye health is a global public priority, transforming lives in both poor and wealthy communities. Therefore, eye health needs to be reframed as a development as well as a health issue and given greater prominence within the global development and health agendas. Vision loss has many causes that require promotional, preventive, treatment, and rehabilitative interventions. Cataract, uncorrected refractive error, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy are responsible for most global vision impairment. Research has identified treatments to reduce or eliminate blindness from all these conditions; the priority is to deliver treatments where they are most needed. Proven eye care interventions, such as cataract surgery and spectacle provision, are among the most cost-effective in all of health care. Greater financial investment is needed so that millions of people living with unnecessary vision impairment and blindness can benefit from these interventions. Lessons from the past three decades give hope that this challenge can be met. Between 1990 and 2020, the age-standardised global prevalence of blindness fell by 28·5%. Since the 1990s, prevalence of major infectious causes of blindness—onchocerciasis and trachoma—have declined substantially. Hope remains that by 2030, the transmission of onchocerciasis will be interrupted, and trachoma will be eliminated as a public health problem in every country worldwide. However, the ageing population has led to a higher crude prevalence of age-related causes of blindness, and thus an increased total number of people with blindness in some regions. Key messagesEye health is essential to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; vision needs to be reframed as a development issueThere is extensive evidence showing that improving eye health contributes directly and indirectly to achieving many Sustainable Development Goals, including reducing poverty and improving work productivity, general and mental health, and education and equity. Improving eye health is a practical and cost-effective way of unlocking human potential. Eye health needs to be reframed as an enabling, cross-cutting issue within the sustainable development framework.Almost everyone will experience impaired vision or an eye condition during their lifetime and require eye care services; urgent action is necessary to meet the rapidly growing eye health needIn 2020, 1·1 billion people had distance vision impairment or uncorrected presbyopia. By 2050, this figure is expected to rise to 1·8 billion. Most affected people live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) with avoidable causes of vision impairment. During the life course, most people will experience vision impairment, even if just the need for reading glasses. Because of unmet needs and an ageing global population, eye health is a major public health and sustainable development concern which warrants urgent political action.Eye health is an essential component of universal health coverage; it must be included in planning, resourcing, and delivery of health careUniversal health coverage is not universal without affordable, high quality, equitable eye care. In line with the WHO World report on vision, we urge countries to consider eye care as an essential service within universal health coverage. To deliver comprehensive services including promotion, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation, eye care needs to be included in national strategic health plans and development policies, health financing structures, and health workforce planning. Coordinated intersectoral action is needed to systematically improve population eye health, also within healthy ageing initiatives, schools, and the workplace. Integration of eye health services with multiple relevant components of health service delivery and at all levels of the health system is of central importance.High quality eye health services are not universally delivered; concerted action is needed to improve quality and outcomes, providing effective, efficient, safe, timely, equitable, and people-centred careUse of effective service coverage indicators for cataract and refractive error highlight the delivery gap between population eye health needs and the delivery of good outcomes. We urge eye health providers to take a holistic view to emphasise quality and design service delivery based on individual and population needs: a people-centred approach. Services need to be characterised by inclusiveness and equity in design and delivery, proactively addressing the needs of marginalised and vulnerable groups through targeted interventions. To encourage improved quality in cataract surgery, we support redefining a good vision outcome threshold as 6/12 or better.Highly cost-effective vision-restoring interventions offer enormous potential to improve the economic outlook of individuals and nations; a major scale up of financial investment in eye health is requiredFor 2020, we estimate that vision impairment resulted in $410·7 billion lost economic productivity; the full cost is most likely higher. Treatments for cataract and refractive error would meet more than 90% of unmet needs and are highly cost-effective. The case for countries to invest in improving population eye health is compelling and more financial resources are urgently required.Financial barriers to accessing eye care leave many people behind; eye health needs to be included in national health financing to pool the riskHealth-care costs prevent many people from accessing essential eye health services. Eye care needs to be integrated into general health system financing to remove cost barriers. To improve access for the whole population and mitigate eye care expenditure, mechanisms that pool risk are highly desirable.Technology and treatment developments offer new tools to improve eye health; thoughtful application is needed to maximise the potential to improve coverage, accessibility, quality, efficiency, and affordabilityTechnological developments such as telemedicine, mHealth, and artificial intelligence offer the potential to revolutionise eye health care in the next decade by delivering affordable, high-quality services to remote areas. However, caution is needed to ensure all populations benefit from these developments.The eye health workforce is unable to meet population needs in many countries; major expansion in service capacity is required through increased numbers, sharing tasks, strengthened training, enabling work environments, and effective leadershipMany areas have major shortages of personnel working in eye health. The available workforce needs to be distributed according to population need. Quality of training for the workforce needs to be updated, with renewed emphasis on competency. Enabling working environments need to be created, including appropriate support, supervision, and equipment. Long-standing issues of low productivity need to be systematically resolved. Mentoring and other programmes to cultivate an emerging generation of eye health leaders are needed.Reliable survey and service data are key to progress in eye health; robust indicator data are needed to shape change and drive actionTo monitor progress in delivering improved eye health within universal health coverage, a balanced set of robust indicators are needed, which we outlined in this Commission. Service data should be available and used by implementers and policy makers to drive change. We highlight the scarcity of epidemiological data in several regions, which should be addressed as a priority.Research has been crucial to advances in understanding and treating eye disease; solution-focused, contextually relevant research is urgently needed to deliver innovative prevention and treatment strategies and inform implementation of eye health within universal health coverageImplementation research is needed, particularly in LMICs, to guide effective delivery of services within universal health coverage. Discovery research is needed for specific areas that remain without efficacious interventions. The economic impact of vision impairment, and the costs and benefits of interventions are only partly understood; a coordinated global effort to systematically collect data is needed. A step-change in the capacity of LMICs to do contextually relevant eye health research and a greater commitment are needed to improve diversity and inclusion in the research community.

A step-change in the capacity of LMICs to do contextually relevant eye health research and a greater commitment are needed to improve diversity and inclusion in the research community. Despite this progress, business as usual will not keep pace with the demographic trends of an ageing global population or address the inequities that persist in each country. New threats to eye health are emerging, including the worldwide increase in diabetic retinopathy, high myopia, retinopathy of prematurity, and chronic eye diseases of ageing such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. With the projected increase in such conditions and their associated vision loss over the coming decades, urgent action is needed to develop innovative treatments and deliver services at a greater scale than previously achieved. Good eye health at the community and national level has been marginalised as a luxury available to only wealthy or urban areas. Eye health needs to be urgently brought into the mainstream of national health and development policy, planning, financing, and action. The challenge is to develop and deliver comprehensive eye health services (promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation) that address the full range of eye conditions within the context of universal health coverage. Accessing services should not bring the risk of falling into poverty and services should be of high quality, as envisaged by the WHO framework for health-care quality: effective, safe, people-centred, timely, equitable, integrated, and efficient. To this framework we add the need for services to be environmentally sustainable. Universal health coverage is not universal without eye care. Multiple obstacles need to be overcome to achieve universal coverage for eye health. Important issues include complex barriers to availability and access to quality services, cost, major shortages and maldistribution of well-trained personnel, and lack of suitable, well maintained equipment and consumables. These issues are particularly widespread in LMICs, but also occur in underserved communities in high-income countries. Strong partnerships need to be formed with natural allies working in areas affected by eye health, such as non-communicable diseases, neglected tropical diseases, healthy ageing, children's services, education, disability, and rehabilitation. The eye health sector has traditionally focused on treatment and rehabilitation, and underused health promotion and prevention strategies to lessen the impact of eye disease and reduce inequality. Solving these problems will depend on solutions established from high quality evidence that can guide more effective implementation at scale. Evidence-based approaches will need to address existing deficiencies in the supply and demand. Strategic investments in discovery research, harnessing new findings from diverse fields, and implementation research to guide effective scale up are needed globally. Encouragingly, developments in telemedicine, mobile health, artificial intelligence, and distance learning could potentially enable eye care professionals to deliver higher quality care that is more plentiful, equitable, and cost-effective. This Commission did a Grand Challenges in Global Eye Health prioritisation exercise to highlight key areas for concerted research and action. This exercise has identified a broad set of challenges spanning the fields of epidemiology, health systems, diagnostics, therapeutics, and implementation. The most compelling of these issues, picked from among 3400 suggestions proposed by 336 people from 118 countries, can help to frame the future research agenda for global eye health. In this Commission, we harness lessons learned from over two decades, present the growing evidence for the life-transforming impact of eye care, and provide a thorough understanding of rapid developments in the field. This report was created through a broad consultation involving experts within and outside the eye care sector to help inform governments and other stakeholders about the path forward for eye health beyond 2020, to further the SDGs (including universal health coverage), and work towards a world without avoidable vision loss. The next few years are a crucial time for the global eye health community and its partners in health care, government, and other sectors to consider the successes and challenges encountered in the past two decades, and at the same time to chart a way forward for the upcoming decades. Moving forward requires building on the strong foundation laid by WHO and partners in VISION 2020 with renewed impetus to ultimately deliver high quality universal eye health care for all.",2021-02-17,2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2214-109x(20)30488-5,1291,-1,0.24820795131529436,"['Matthew J.

LoFTR: Detector-Free Local Feature Matching with Transformers,"We present a novel method for local image feature matching. Instead of performing image feature detection, description, and matching sequentially, we propose to first establish pixel-wise dense matches at a coarse level and later refine the good matches at a fine level. In contrast to dense methods that use a cost volume to search correspondences, we use self and cross attention layers in Transformer to obtain feature descriptors that are conditioned on both images. The global receptive field provided by Transformer enables our method to produce dense matches in low-texture areas, where feature detectors usually struggle to produce repeatable interest points. The experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that LoFTR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. LoFTR also ranks first on two public benchmarks of visual localization among the published methods.

Delphi methodology in healthcare research: How to decide its appropriateness,"The Delphi technique is a systematic process of forecasting using the collective opinion of panel members. The structured method of developing consensus among panel members using Delphi methodology has gained acceptance in diverse fields of medicine. The Delphi methods assumed a pivotal role in the last few decades to develop best practice guidance using collective intelligence where research is limited, ethically/logistically difficult or evidence is conflicting. However, the attempts to assess the quality standard of Delphi studies have reported significant variance, and details of the process followed are usually unclear. We recommend systematic quality tools for evaluation of Delphi methodology; identification of problem area of research, selection of panel, anonymity of panelists, controlled feedback, iterative Delphi rounds, consensus criteria, analysis of consensus, closing criteria, and stability of the results. Based on these nine qualitative evaluation points, we assessed the quality of Delphi studies in the medical field related to coronavirus disease 2019. There was inconsistency in reporting vital elements of Delphi methods such as identification of panel members, defining consensus, closing criteria for rounds, and presenting the results. We propose our evaluation points for researchers, medical journal editorial boards, and reviewers to evaluate the quality of the Delphi methods in healthcare research.",2021-07-19,2021,https://doi.org/10.5662/wjm.v11.i4.116,1290,2,0.22638510965292222,"['Prashant Nasa', 'Ravi Jain', 'Deven Juneja']",,True

CBTRUS Statistical Report: Primary Brain and Other Central Nervous System Tumors Diagnosed in the United States in 2015–2019,"Abstract The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS), in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute, is the largest population-based registry focused exclusively on primary brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tumors in the United States (US) and represents the entire US population. This report contains the most up-to-date population-based data on primary brain tumors available and supersedes all previous reports in terms of completeness and accuracy. All rates are age-adjusted using the 2000 US standard population and presented per 100,000 population. The average annual age-adjusted incidence rate (AAAIR) of all malignant and non-malignant brain and other CNS tumors was 24.71 per 100,000 population (malignant AAAIR=7.02 and non-malignant AAAIR=17.69). This overall rate was higher in females compared to males (27.62 versus 21.60 per 100,000) and non-Hispanic persons compared to Hispanic persons (25.09 versus 22.95 per 100,000). The most commonly occurring malignant brain and other CNS histopathology was glioblastoma (14.2% of all tumors and 50.1% of all malignant tumors), and the most common non-malignant histopathology was meningioma (39.7% of all tumors and 55.4% of all non-malignant tumors). Glioblastoma was more common in males, and meningiomas were more common in females. In children and adolescents (ages 0-19 years), the incidence rate of all primary brain and other CNS tumors was 6.20 per 100,000 population. An estimated 93,470 new cases of malignant and non-malignant brain and other CNS tumors are expected to be diagnosed in the US population in 2022 (26,670 malignant and 66,806 non-malignant). There were 84,264 deaths attributed to malignant brain and other CNS tumors between 2015 and 2019. This represents an average annual mortality rate of 4.41 per 100,000 population and an average of 16,853 deaths per year. The five-year relative survival rate following diagnosis of a malignant brain and other CNS tumor was 35.7%, while for non-malignant brain and other CNS tumors the five-year relative survival rate was 91.8%.",2022-10-05,2022,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/noac202,1287,-1,0.3818127694130107,"['Quinn T.

"Global epidemiology, health burden and effective interventions for elevated blood pressure and hypertension","High blood pressure is one of the most important risk factors for ischaemic heart disease, stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease and dementia. Mean blood pressure and the prevalence of raised blood pressure have declined substantially in high-income regions since at least the 1970s. By contrast, blood pressure has risen in East, South and Southeast Asia, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa. Given these trends, the prevalence of hypertension is now higher in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. In 2015, an estimated 8.5 million deaths were attributable to systolic blood pressure >115 mmHg, 88% of which were in low-income and middle-income countries. Measures such as increasing the availability and affordability of fresh fruits and vegetables, lowering the sodium content of packaged and prepared food and staples such as bread, and improving the availability of dietary salt substitutes can help lower blood pressure in the entire population. The use and effectiveness of hypertension treatment vary substantially across countries. Factors influencing this variation include a country's financial resources, the extent of health insurance and health facilities, how frequently people interact with physicians and non-physician health personnel, whether a clear and widely adopted clinical guideline exists and the availability of medicines. Scaling up treatment coverage and improving its community effectiveness can substantially reduce the health burden of hypertension.",2021-05-28,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41569-021-00559-8,1285,1,0.5046450147158474,"['Bin Zhou', 'Pablo Perel', 'George A.

Analysis of Points of Interests Recommended for Leisure Walk Descriptions,"Leisure walking is a physical activity where locomotion through a natural or even urban environment is the goal in itself, e.g., in pursuit of health and wellbeing. In contrast to destination-oriented walks that are focused on navigation efficiency (i.e., shortest or simplest walk from source to destination), leisure walks emphasize experiencing the environment, engaging in activities, and discovering places that may be off route, or intermediate destinations en-route, summarily called points of interest (POIs). POIs are key for recommending leisure walks, yet a detailed analysis of POIs in the context of leisure walking is missing in the literature. This study extracts and annotates POIs of leisure walking recommendations available in WalkingMaps.com.au, creating an annotated dataset to address this research gap and provide a first analysis of leisure walking descriptions. We classify POIs using the verbal description provided in the dataset, match them with data available in OpenStreetMap (OSM), and compare the POIs with nearby alternatives in OSM. Our analysis reveals thematic and spatial patterns in POI selection, offering a machine learning approach to model POI choices for leisure walks. We further evaluate the availability of rich data in OSM for future automated leisure walking recommendation.

Chitosan: An Overview of Its Properties and Applications,"Chitosan has garnered much interest due to its properties and possible applications. Every year the number of publications and patents based on this polymer increase. Chitosan exhibits poor solubility in neutral and basic media, limiting its use in such conditions. Another serious obstacle is directly related to its natural origin. Chitosan is not a single polymer with a defined structure but a family of molecules with differences in their composition, size, and monomer distribution. These properties have a fundamental effect on the biological and technological performance of the polymer. Moreover, some of the biological properties claimed are discrete. In this review, we discuss how chitosan chemistry can solve the problems related to its poor solubility and can boost the polymer properties. We focus on some of the main biological properties of chitosan and the relationship with the physicochemical properties of the polymer. Then, we review two polymer applications related to green processes: the use of chitosan in the green synthesis of metallic nanoparticles and its use as support for biocatalysts. Finally, we briefly describe how making use of the technological properties of chitosan makes it possible to develop a variety of systems for drug delivery.",2021-09-24,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13193256,1281,4,1.0,"['Inmaculada Aranaz', 'Andrés R.

pixelNeRF: Neural Radiance Fields from One or Few Images,"We propose pixelNeRF, a learning framework that predicts a continuous neural scene representation conditioned on one or few input images. The existing approach for constructing neural radiance fields [27] involves optimizing the representation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated views and significant compute time. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on image inputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trained across multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, enabling it to perform novel view synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few as one). Leveraging the volume rendering approach of NeRF, our model can be trained directly from images with no explicit 3D supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on ShapeNet benchmarks for single image novel view synthesis tasks with held-out objects as well as entire unseen categories. We further demonstrate the flexibility of pixelNeRF by demonstrating it on multi-object ShapeNet scenes and real scenes from the DTU dataset. In all cases, pixelNeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for novel view synthesis and single image 3D reconstruction.

"Long COVID or post-COVID-19 syndrome: putative pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatments","Long COVID or post-COVID-19 syndrome first gained widespread recognition among social support groups and later in scientific and medical communities. This illness is poorly understood as it affects COVID-19 survivors at all levels of disease severity, even younger adults, children, and those not hospitalized. While the precise definition of long COVID may be lacking, the most common symptoms reported in many studies are fatigue and dyspnoea that last for months after acute COVID-19. Other persistent symptoms may include cognitive and mental impairments, chest and joint pains, palpitations, myalgia, smell and taste dysfunctions, cough, headache, and gastrointestinal and cardiac issues. Presently, there is limited literature discussing the possible pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatments in long COVID, which the current review aims to address. In brief, long COVID may be driven by long-term tissue damage (e.g. lung, brain, and heart) and pathological inflammation (e.g. from viral persistence, immune dysregulation, and autoimmunity). The associated risk factors may include female sex, more than five early symptoms, early dyspnoea, prior psychiatric disorders, and specific biomarkers (e.g. D-dimer, CRP, and lymphocyte count), although more research is required to substantiate such risk factors. While preliminary evidence suggests that personalized rehabilitation training may help certain long COVID cases, therapeutic drugs repurposed from other similar conditions, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and mast cell activation syndrome, also hold potential. In sum, this review hopes to provide the current understanding of what is known about long COVID.",2021-05-22,2021,https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2021.1924397,1272,1,1.0,['Shin Jie Yong'],,True

Pharmaceutical pollution of the world’s rivers,"Environmental exposure to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) can have negative effects on the health of ecosystems and humans. While numerous studies have monitored APIs in rivers, these employ different analytical methods, measure different APIs, and have ignored many of the countries of the world. This makes it difficult to quantify the scale of the problem from a global perspective. Furthermore, comparison of the existing data, generated for different studies/regions/continents, is challenging due to the vast differences between the analytical methodologies employed. Here, we present a global-scale study of API pollution in 258 of the world’s rivers, representing the environmental influence of 471.4 million people across 137 geographic regions. Samples were obtained from 1,052 locations in 104 countries (representing all continents and 36 countries not previously studied for API contamination) and analyzed for 61 APIs. Highest cumulative API concentrations were observed in sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and South America. The most contaminated sites were in low- to middle-income countries and were associated with areas with poor wastewater and waste management infrastructure and pharmaceutical manufacturing. The most frequently detected APIs were carbamazepine, metformin, and caffeine (a compound also arising from lifestyle use), which were detected at over half of the sites monitored. Concentrations of at least one API at 25.7% of the sampling sites were greater than concentrations considered safe for aquatic organisms, or which are of concern in terms of selection for antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, pharmaceutical pollution poses a global threat to environmental and human health, as well as to delivery of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",2022-02-14,2022,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2113947119,1270,-1,0.2849430679796739,"['John L.

Measurement of the Positive Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment to 0.46 ppm,"We present the first results of the Fermilab Muon g-2 Experiment for the positive muon magnetic anomaly $a_\\mu \\equiv (g_\\mu-2)/2$. The anomaly is determined from the precision measurements of two angular frequencies. Intensity variation of high-energy positrons from muon decays directly encodes the difference frequency $\\omega_a$ between the spin-precession and cyclotron frequencies for polarized muons in a magnetic storage ring. The storage ring magnetic field is measured using nuclear magnetic resonance probes calibrated in terms of the equivalent proton spin precession frequency ${\\tilde{\\omega}'^{}_p}$ in a spherical water sample at 34.7$^{\\circ}$C. The ratio $\\omega_a / {\\tilde{\\omega}'^{}_p}$, together with known fundamental constants, determines $a_\\mu({\\rm FNAL}) = 116\\,592\\,040(54)\\times 10^{-11}$ (0.46\\,ppm). The result is 3.3 standard deviations greater than the standard model prediction and is in excellent agreement with the previous Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) E821 measurement. After combination with previous measurements of both $\\mu^+$ and $\\mu^-$, the new experimental average of $a_\\mu({\\rm Exp}) = 116\\,592\\,061(41)\\times 10^{-11}$ (0.35\\,ppm) increases the tension between experiment and theory to 4.2 standard deviations",2021-04-07,2021,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.126.141801,1270,6,0.7575447635683418,"['B.

Assessing transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in England,"The SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, designated variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 by Public Health England<sup>1</sup>, was first identified in the UK in late summer to early autumn 2020<sup>2</sup>. Whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequence data collected from community-based diagnostic testing for COVID-19 show an extremely rapid expansion of the B.1.1.7 lineage during autumn 2020, suggesting that it has a selective advantage. Here we show that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Analysis of trends in SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers in local areas across England shows that B.1.1.7 has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if it has a different latent period or generation time. The SGTF data indicate a transient shift in the age composition of reported cases, with cases of B.1.1.7 including a larger share of under 20-year-olds than non-VOC cases. We estimated time-varying reproduction numbers for B.1.1.7 and co-circulating lineages using SGTF and genomic data. The best-supported models did not indicate a substantial difference in VOC transmissibility among different age groups, but all analyses agreed that B.1.1.7 has a substantial transmission advantage over other lineages, with a 50% to 100% higher reproduction number.",2021-03-25,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03470-x,1269,1,0.1840810589526666,"['Erik Volz', 'Swapnil Mishra', 'Meera Chand', 'Jeffrey C.

An evidence review of face masks against COVID-19,"The science around the use of masks by the public to impede COVID-19 transmission is advancing rapidly. In this narrative review, we develop an analytical framework to examine mask usage, synthesizing the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: population impact, transmission characteristics, source control, wearer protection, sociological considerations, and implementation considerations. A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is via respiratory particles, and it is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires two things: limiting contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and other measures and reducing the transmission probability per contact. The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high. Given the current shortages of medical masks, we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. Because many respiratory particles become smaller due to evaporation, we recommend increasing focus on a previously overlooked aspect of mask usage: mask wearing by infectious people (“source control”) with benefits at the population level, rather than only mask wearing by susceptible people, such as health care workers, with focus on individual outcomes. We recommend that public officials and governments strongly encourage the use of widespread face masks in public, including the use of appropriate regulation.",2021-01-11,2021,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2014564118,1268,-1,0.13409718597705925,"['Jeremy Howard', 'Austin Huang', 'Zhiyuan Li', 'Zeynep Tüfekçi', 'Vladimir Ždı́mal', 'Helene‐Mari van der Westhuizen', 'Arne von Delft', 'Amy Price', 'Lex Fridman', 'Lei‐Han Tang', 'Viola Tang', 'Gregory L.

Antibody drug conjugate: the “biological missile” for targeted cancer therapy,"Abstract Antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) is typically composed of a monoclonal antibody (mAbs) covalently attached to a cytotoxic drug via a chemical linker. It combines both the advantages of highly specific targeting ability and highly potent killing effect to achieve accurate and efficient elimination of cancer cells, which has become one of the hotspots for the research and development of anticancer drugs. Since the first ADC, Mylotarg ® (gemtuzumab ozogamicin), was approved in 2000 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there have been 14 ADCs received market approval so far worldwide. Moreover, over 100 ADC candidates have been investigated in clinical stages at present. This kind of new anti-cancer drugs, known as “biological missiles”, is leading a new era of targeted cancer therapy. Herein, we conducted a review of the history and general mechanism of action of ADCs, and then briefly discussed the molecular aspects of key components of ADCs and the mechanisms by which these key factors influence the activities of ADCs. Moreover, we also reviewed the approved ADCs and other promising candidates in phase-3 clinical trials and discuss the current challenges and future perspectives for the development of next generations, which provide insights for the research and development of novel cancer therapeutics using ADCs.",2022-03-22,2022,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-022-00947-7,1268,3,0.7570804759705768,"['Zhiwen Fu', 'Shijun Li', 'Sifei Han', 'Shi Chen', 'Yu Zhang']",,True
The International Consensus Classification of Mature Lymphoid Neoplasms: a report from the Clinical Advisory Committee,"Abstract Since the publication of the Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms in 1994, subsequent updates of the classification of lymphoid neoplasms have been generated through iterative international efforts to achieve broad consensus among hematopathologists, geneticists, molecular scientists, and clinicians. Significant progress has recently been made in the characterization of malignancies of the immune system, with many new insights provided by genomic studies. They have led to this proposal. We have followed the same process that was successfully used for the third and fourth editions of the World Health Organization Classification of Hematologic Neoplasms. The definition, recommended studies, and criteria for the diagnosis of many entities have been extensively refined. Some categories considered provisional have now been upgraded to definite entities. Terminology for some diseases has been revised to adapt nomenclature to the current knowledge of their biology, but these modifications have been restricted to well-justified situations. Major findings from recent genomic studies have impacted the conceptual framework and diagnostic criteria for many disease entities. These changes will have an impact on optimal clinical management. The conclusions of this work are summarized in this report as the proposed International Consensus Classification of mature lymphoid, histiocytic, and dendritic cell tumors.",2022-06-02,2022,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2022015851,1268,3,1.0,"['Elı́as Campo', 'Elaine S.

A practical guide to reflexivity in qualitative research: AMEE Guide No. 149,"Qualitative research relies on nuanced judgements that require researcher reflexivity, yet reflexivity is often addressed superficially or overlooked completely during the research process. In this AMEE Guide, we define reflexivity as a set of continuous, collaborative, and multifaceted practices through which researchers self-consciously critique, appraise, and evaluate how their subjectivity and context influence the research processes. We frame reflexivity as a way to embrace and value researchers' subjectivity. We also describe the purposes that reflexivity can have depending on different paradigmatic choices. We then address how researchers can account for the significance of the intertwined personal, interpersonal, methodological, and contextual factors that bring research into being and offer specific strategies for communicating reflexivity in research dissemination. With the growth of qualitative research in health professions education, it is essential that qualitative researchers carefully consider their paradigmatic stance and use reflexive practices to align their decisions at all stages of their research.

Global Prevalence of Post-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Condition or Long COVID: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review,"Abstract Background This study aims to examine the worldwide prevalence of post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) condition, through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods PubMed, Embase, and iSearch were searched on July 5, 2021 with verification extending to March 13, 2022. Using a random-effects framework with DerSimonian-Laird estimator, we meta-analyzed post-COVID-19 condition prevalence at 28+ days from infection. Results Fifty studies were included, and 41 were meta-analyzed. Global estimated pooled prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition was 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI], .39–.46). Hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients had estimates of 0.54 (95% CI, .44–.63) and 0.34 (95% CI, .25–.46), respectively. Regional prevalence estimates were Asia (0.51; 95% CI, .37–.65), Europe (0.44; 95% CI, .32–.56), and United States of America (0.31; 95% CI, .21–.43). Global prevalence for 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after infection were estimated to be 0.37 (95% CI, .26–.49), 0.25 (95% CI, .15–.38), 0.32 (95% CI, .14–.57), and 0.49 (95% CI, .40–.59), respectively. Fatigue was the most common symptom reported with a prevalence of 0.23 (95% CI, .17–.30), followed by memory problems (0.14; 95% CI, .10–.19). Conclusions This study finds post-COVID-19 condition prevalence is substantial; the health effects of COVID-19 seem to be prolonged and can exert stress on the healthcare system.",2022-04-14,2022,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiac136,1262,1,1.0,"['Chen Chen', 'Spencer R.

Antimicrobial Resistance: A Growing Serious Threat for Global Public Health,"Antibiotics are among the most important discoveries of the 20th century, having saved millions of lives from infectious diseases. Microbes have developed acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to many drugs due to high selection pressure from increasing use and misuse of antibiotics over the years. The transmission and acquisition of AMR occur primarily via a human–human interface both within and outside of healthcare facilities. A huge number of interdependent factors related to healthcare and agriculture govern the development of AMR through various drug-resistance mechanisms. The emergence and spread of AMR from the unrestricted use of antimicrobials in livestock feed has been a major contributing factor. The prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria has attained an incongruous level worldwide and threatens global public health as a silent pandemic, necessitating urgent intervention. Therapeutic options of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are limited, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality with high financial impact. The paucity in discovery and supply of new novel antimicrobials to treat life-threatening infections by resistant pathogens stands in sharp contrast to demand.

Sample Size Justification,"An important step when designing an empirical study is to justify the sample size that will be collected. The key aim of a sample size justification for such studies is to explain how the collected data is expected to provide valuable information given the inferential goals of the researcher. In this overview article six approaches are discussed to justify the sample size in a quantitative empirical study: 1) collecting data from (almost) the entire population, 2) choosing a sample size based on resource constraints, 3) performing an a-priori power analysis, 4) planning for a desired accuracy, 5) using heuristics, or 6) explicitly acknowledging the absence of a justification. An important question to consider when justifying sample sizes is which effect sizes are deemed interesting, and the extent to which the data that is collected informs inferences about these effect sizes. Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers could consider 1) what the smallest effect size of interest is, 2) which minimal effect size will be statistically significant, 3) which effect sizes they expect (and what they base these expectations on), 4) which effect sizes would be rejected based on a confidence interval around the effect size, 5) which ranges of effects a study has sufficient power to detect based on a sensitivity power analysis, and 6) which effect sizes are expected in a specific research area. Researchers can use the guidelines presented in this article, for example by using the interactive form in the accompanying online Shiny app, to improve their sample size justification, and hopefully, align the informational value of a study with their inferential goals.",2022-01-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.33267,1258,2,0.6937315862153304,['Daniël Lakens'],,True

"Review on Methylene Blue: Its Properties, Uses, Toxicity and Photodegradation","The unavailability of clean drinking water is one of the significant health issues in modern times. Industrial dyes are one of the dominant chemicals that make water unfit for drinking. Among these dyes, methylene blue (MB) is toxic, carcinogenic, and non-biodegradable and can cause a severe threat to human health and environmental safety. It is usually released in natural water sources, which becomes a health threat to human beings and living organisms. Hence, there is a need to develop an environmentally friendly, efficient technology for removing MB from wastewater. Photodegradation is an advanced oxidation process widely used for MB removal. It has the advantages of complete mineralization of dye into simple and nontoxic species with the potential to decrease the processing cost. This review provides a tutorial basis for the readers working in the dye degradation research area. We not only covered the basic principles of the process but also provided a wide range of previously published work on advanced photocatalytic systems (single-component and multi-component photocatalysts). Our study has focused on critical parameters that can affect the photodegradation rate of MB, such as photocatalyst type and loading, irradiation reaction time, pH of reaction media, initial concentration of dye, radical scavengers and oxidising agents. The photodegradation mechanism, reaction pathways, intermediate products, and final products of MB are also summarized. An overview of the future perspectives to utilize MB at an industrial scale is also provided. This paper identifies strategies for the development of effective MB photodegradation systems.",2022-01-14,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/w14020242,1256,4,0.28223641108317044,"['Idrees Khan', 'Khalid Saeed', 'Ivar Zekker', 'Baoliang Zhang', 'Abdulmajeed Hendi', 'Ashfaq Ahmad', 'Shujaat Ahmad', 'Noor Zada', 'Hanif Ahmad', 'Luqman Ali Shah', 'Tariq Shah', 'Ibrahim Khan']",,True

Revisiting Event-Study Designs: Robust and Efficient Estimation,"Abstract We develop a framework for difference-in-differences designs with staggered treatment adoption and heterogeneous causal effects. We show that conventional regression-based estimators fail to provide unbiased estimates of relevant estimands absent strong restrictions on treatment-effect homogeneity. We then derive the efficient estimator addressing this challenge, which takes an intuitive “imputation” form when treatment-effect heterogeneity is unrestricted. We characterize the asymptotic behaviour of the estimator, propose tools for inference, and develop tests for identifying assumptions. Our method applies with time-varying controls, in triple-difference designs, and with certain non-binary treatments. We show the practical relevance of our results in a simulation study and an application. Studying the consumption response to tax rebates in the U.S., we find that the notional marginal propensity to consume is between 8 and 11% in the first quarter—about half as large as benchmark estimates used to calibrate macroeconomic models—and predominantly occurs in the first month after the rebate.",2024-02-06,2024,https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdae007,1254,2,0.422254940368912,"['Kirill Borusyak', 'Xavier Jaravel', 'Jann Spiess']",,True

Artificial Intelligence and Management: The Automation–Augmentation Paradox,"Taking three recent business books on artificial intelligence (AI) as a starting point, we explore the automation and augmentation concepts in the management domain. Whereas automation implies that machines take over a human task, augmentation means that humans collaborate closely with machines to perform a task. Taking a normative stance, the three books advise organizations to prioritize augmentation, which they relate to superior performance. Using a more comprehensive paradox theory perspective, we argue that, in the management domain, augmentation cannot be neatly separated from automation. These dual AI applications are interdependent across time and space, creating a paradoxical tension. Overemphasizing either augmentation or automation fuels reinforcing cycles with negative organizational and societal outcomes. However, if organizations adopt a broader perspective comprising both automation and augmentation, they could deal with the tension and achieve complementarities that benefit business and society. Drawing on our insights, we conclude that management scholars need to be involved in research on the use of AI in organizations. We also argue that a substantial change is required in how AI research is currently conducted in order to develop meaningful theory and to provide practice with sound advice.",2021-01-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.2018.0072,1253,-1,0.25472127250791965,"['Sebastian Raisch', 'Sebastian Krakowski']",,True
"Reporting reliability, convergent and discriminant validity with structural equation modeling: A review and best-practice recommendations","Abstract Many constructs in management studies, such as perceptions, personalities, attitudes, and behavioral intentions, are not directly observable. Typically, empirical studies measure such constructs using established scales with multiple indicators. When the scales are used in a different population, the items are translated into other languages or revised to adapt to other populations, it is essential for researchers to report the quality of measurement scales before using them to test hypotheses. Researchers commonly report the quality of these measurement scales based on Cronbach’s alpha and confirmatory factor analysis results. However, these results are usually inadequate and sometimes inappropriate. Moreover, researchers rarely consider sampling errors for these psychometric quality measures. In this best practice paper, we first critically review the most frequently-used approaches in empirical studies to evaluate the quality of measurement scales when using structural equation modeling. Next, we recommend best practices in assessing reliability, convergent and discriminant validity based on multiple criteria and taking sampling errors into consideration. Then, we illustrate with numerical examples the application of a specifically-developed R package, measureQ, that provides a one-stop solution for implementing the recommended best practices and a template for reporting the results. measureQ is easy to implement, even for those new to R. Our overall aim is to provide a best-practice reference for future authors, reviewers, and editors in reporting and reviewing the quality of measurement scales in empirical management studies.",2023-01-30,2023,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10490-023-09871-y,1251,2,1.0,"['Gordon W.

The Division of Labour in Society,"Although the division of labour is not of recent origin, it was only at the end of the last century that societies began to become aware of this law, to which up to then they had submitted almost unwittingly. Undoubtedly even from antiquity several thinkers had perceived its importance.1 Yet Adam Smith was the first to attempt to elaborate the theory of it. Moreover, it was he who first coined the term, which social science later lent to biology. Nowadays the phenomenon has become so widespread that it catches everyone's attention. It involves increasingly powerful mechanisms, large-scale groupings of power and capital, and consequently an extreme division of labour.

This complex contains the most polymorphic genes in the human genome and is now considered hyperpolymorphic. The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database provides a stable and user-friendly repository for this information. Uptake of Next Generation Sequencing technology in recent years has driven an increase in the number of alleles and the length of sequences submitted. As the size of the database has grown the traditional methods of accessing and presenting this data have been challenged, in response, we have developed a suite of tools providing an enhanced user experience to our traditional web-based users while creating new programmatic access for our bioinformatics user base.

The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Evidence for a Gravitational-wave Background,"Abstract We report multiple lines of evidence for a stochastic signal that is correlated among 67 pulsars from the 15 yr pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves. The correlations follow the Hellings–Downs pattern expected for a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The presence of such a gravitational-wave background with a power-law spectrum is favored over a model with only independent pulsar noises with a Bayes factor in excess of 10 14 , and this same model is favored over an uncorrelated common power-law spectrum model with Bayes factors of 200–1000, depending on spectral modeling choices. We have built a statistical background distribution for the latter Bayes factors using a method that removes interpulsar correlations from our data set, finding p = 10 −3 (≈3 σ ) for the observed Bayes factors in the null no-correlation scenario. A frequentist test statistic built directly as a weighted sum of interpulsar correlations yields p = 5 × 10 −5 to 1.9 × 10 −4 (≈3.5 σ –4 σ ).

Secure Routing in Mobile Ad hoc Networks,"The emergence of the Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET) technology advocates self-organized wireless interconnection of communication devices that would either extend or operate in concert with the wired networking infrastructure or, possibly, evolve to autonomous networks. In either case, the proliferation of MANET-based applications depends on a multitude of factors, with trustworthiness being one of the primary challenges to be met. Despite the existence of well-known security mechanisms, additional vulnerabilities and features pertinent to this new networking paradigm might render such traditional solutions inapplicable. In particular, the absence of a central authorization facility in an open and distributed communication environment is a major challenge, especially due to the need for cooperative network operation. In particular, in MANET, any node may compromise the routing protocol functionality by disrupting the route discovery process. In this paper, we present a route discovery protocol that mitigates the detrimental effects of such malicious behavior, as to provide correct connectivity information. Our protocol guarantees that fabricated, compromised, or replayed route replies would either be rejected or never reach back the querying node. Furthermore, the protocol responsiveness is safeguarded under different types of attacks that exploit the routing protocol itself. The sole requirement of the proposed scheme is the existence of a security association between the node initiating the query and the sought destination. Specifically, no assumption is made regarding the intermediate nodes, which may exhibit arbitrary and malicious behavior. The scheme is robust in the presence of a number of non-colluding nodes, and provides accurate routing information in a timely manner.",2022-01-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.22271/ed.book.2027,1241,0,1.0,[],,False
RePaint: Inpainting using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models,"Free-form inpainting is the task of adding new content to an image in the regions specified by an arbitrary binary mask. Most existing approaches train for a certain distribution of masks, which limits their generalization capabilities to unseen mask types. Furthermore, training with pixel-wise and perceptual losses often leads to simple textural extensions towards the missing areas instead of semantically meaningful generation. In this work, we propose RePaint: A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based inpainting approach that is applicable to even extreme masks. We employ a pretrained unconditional DDPM as the generative prior. To condition the generation process, we only alter the reverse diffusion iterations by sampling the unmasked regions using the given image infor-mation. Since this technique does not modify or condition the original DDPM network itself, the model produces high-quality and diverse output images for any inpainting form. We validate our method for both faces and general-purpose image inpainting using standard and extreme masks. Re-Paint outperforms state-of-the-art Autoregressive, and GAN approaches for at least five out of six mask distributions.

Diffusion Models in Vision: A Survey,"Denoising diffusion models represent a recent emerging topic in computer vision, demonstrating remarkable results in the area of generative modeling. A diffusion model is a deep generative model that is based on two stages, a forward diffusion stage and a reverse diffusion stage. In the forward diffusion stage, the input data is gradually perturbed over several steps by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse stage, a model is tasked at recovering the original input data by learning to gradually reverse the diffusion process, step by step. Diffusion models are widely appreciated for the quality and diversity of the generated samples, despite their known computational burdens, i.e., low speeds due to the high number of steps involved during sampling. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of articles on denoising diffusion models applied in vision, comprising both theoretical and practical contributions in the field. First, we identify and present three generic diffusion modeling frameworks, which are based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise conditioned score networks, and stochastic differential equations. We further discuss the relations between diffusion models and other deep generative models, including variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks, energy-based models, autoregressive models and normalizing flows. Then, we introduce a multi-perspective categorization of diffusion models applied in computer vision. Finally, we illustrate the current limitations of diffusion models and envision some interesting directions for future research.",2023-03-27,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/tpami.2023.3261988,1234,0,1.0,"['Florinel-Alin Croitoru', 'Vlad Hondru', 'Radu Tudor Ionescu', 'Mubarak Shah']",,False

Enhancing Geometric Factors in Model Learning and Inference for Object Detection and Instance Segmentation,"Deep learning-based object detection and instance segmentation have achieved unprecedented progress. In this article, we propose complete-IoU (CIoU) loss and Cluster-NMS for enhancing geometric factors in both bounding-box regression and nonmaximum suppression (NMS), leading to notable gains of average precision (AP) and average recall (AR), without the sacrifice of inference efficiency. In particular, we consider three geometric factors, that is: 1) overlap area; 2) normalized central-point distance; and 3) aspect ratio, which are crucial for measuring bounding-box regression in object detection and instance segmentation. The three geometric factors are then incorporated into CIoU loss for better distinguishing difficult regression cases. The training of deep models using CIoU loss results in consistent AP and AR improvements in comparison to widely adopted l<sub>n</sub> -norm loss and IoU-based loss. Furthermore, we propose Cluster-NMS, where NMS during inference is done by implicitly clustering detected boxes and usually requires fewer iterations. Cluster-NMS is very efficient due to its pure GPU implementation, and geometric factors can be incorporated to improve both AP and AR. In the experiments, CIoU loss and Cluster-NMS have been applied to state-of-the-art instance segmentation (e.g., YOLACT and BlendMask-RT), and object detection (e.g., YOLO v3, SSD, and Faster R-CNN) models. Taking YOLACT on MS COCO as an example, our method achieves performance gains as +1.7 AP and +6.2 AR<sub>100</sub> for object detection, and +1.1 AP and +3.5 AR<sub>100</sub> for instance segmentation, with 27.1 FPS on one NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU.

Flamingo: a Visual Language Model for Few-Shot Learning,"Building models that can be rapidly adapted to novel tasks using only a handful of annotated examples is an open challenge for multimodal machine learning research. We introduce Flamingo, a family of Visual Language Models (VLM) with this ability. We propose key architectural innovations to: (i) bridge powerful pretrained vision-only and language-only models, (ii) handle sequences of arbitrarily interleaved visual and textual data, and (iii) seamlessly ingest images or videos as inputs. Thanks to their flexibility, Flamingo models can be trained on large-scale multimodal web corpora containing arbitrarily interleaved text and images, which is key to endow them with in-context few-shot learning capabilities. We perform a thorough evaluation of our models, exploring and measuring their ability to rapidly adapt to a variety of image and video tasks. These include open-ended tasks such as visual question-answering, where the model is prompted with a question which it has to answer; captioning tasks, which evaluate the ability to describe a scene or an event; and close-ended tasks such as multiple-choice visual question-answering. For tasks lying anywhere on this spectrum, a single Flamingo model can achieve a new state of the art with few-shot learning, simply by prompting the model with task-specific examples. On numerous benchmarks, Flamingo outperforms models fine-tuned on thousands of times more task-specific data.",2022-04-29,2022,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2204.14198,1234,0,0.5410644916692543,"['Jean-Baptiste Alayrac', 'Jeff Donahue', 'Pauline Luc', 'Antoine Miech', 'Iain Barr', 'Yana Hasson', 'Karel Lenc', 'Arthur Mensch', 'Katie Millican', 'Malcolm Reynolds', 'Roman Ring', 'Eliza Rutherford', 'Serkan Cabi', 'Tengda Han', 'Zhitao Gong', 'Sina Samangooei', 'Marianne Monteiro', 'Jacob Menick', 'Sebastian Borgeaud', 'Andrew Brock', 'Aida Nematzadeh', 'Sahand Sharifzadeh', 'Mikołaj Bińkowski', 'Ricardo Barreira', 'Oriol Vinyals', 'Andrew Zisserman', 'Karen Simonyan']",,True

"CB-Dock2: improved protein–ligand blind docking by integrating cavity detection, docking and homologous template fitting","Abstract Protein-ligand blind docking is a powerful method for exploring the binding sites of receptors and the corresponding binding poses of ligands. It has seen wide applications in pharmaceutical and biological researches. Previously, we proposed a blind docking server, CB-Dock, which has been under heavy use (over 200 submissions per day) by researchers worldwide since 2019. Here, we substantially improved the docking method by combining CB-Dock with our template-based docking engine to enhance the accuracy in binding site identification and binding pose prediction. In the benchmark tests, it yielded the success rate of ∼85% for binding pose prediction (RMSD &amp;lt; 2.0 Å), which outperformed original CB-Dock and most popular blind docking tools. This updated docking server, named CB-Dock2, reconfigured the input and output web interfaces, together with a highly automatic docking pipeline, making it a particularly efficient and easy-to-use tool for the bioinformatics and cheminformatics communities.

Completed SDSS-IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey: Cosmological implications from two decades of spectroscopic surveys at the Apache Point Observatory,"We present the cosmological implications from final measurements of clustering using galaxies, quasars, and Lyα forests from the completed Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) lineage of experiments in large-scale structure. These experiments, composed of data from SDSS, SDSS-II, BOSS, and eBOSS, offer independent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements of angular-diameter distances and Hubble distances relative to the sound horizon, r&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, from eight different samples and six measurements of the growth rate parameter, fσ&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, from redshift-space distortions (RSD). This composite sample is the most constraining of its kind and allows us to perform a comprehensive assessment of the cosmological model after two decades of dedicated spectroscopic observation. We show that the BAO data alone are able to rule out dark-energy-free models at more than eight standard deviations in an extension to the flat, ΛCDM model that allows for curvature. When combined with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements of temperature and polarization, under the same model, the BAO data provide nearly an order of magnitude improvement on curvature constraints relative to primary CMB constraints alone. Independent of distance measurements, the SDSS RSD data complement weak lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) in demonstrating a preference for a flat ΛCDM cosmological model when combined with Planck measurements. The combined BAO and RSD measurements indicate σ&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;=0.85±0.03, implying a growth rate that is consistent with predictions from Planck temperature and polarization data and with General Relativity. When combining the results of SDSS BAO and RSD, Planck, Pantheon Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and DES weak lensing and clustering measurements, all multiple-parameter extensions remain consistent with a ΛCDM model. Regardless of cosmological model, the precision on each of the three parameters, Ω&lt;sup&gt;Λ&lt;/sup&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and σ&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, remains at roughly 1%, showing changes of less than 0.6% in the central values between models. In a model that allows for free curvature and a time-evolving equation of state for dark energy, the combined samples produce a constraint Ω&lt;sup&gt;K&lt;/sup&gt;=-0.0022±0.0022. The dark energy constraints lead to w&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=-0.909±0.081 and w&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=$-0.49_{-0.30}^{+0.35}$, corresponding to an equation of state of w&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=-1.018±0.032 at a pivot redshift z&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=0.29 and a Dark Energy Task Force Figure of Merit of 94. The inverse distance ladder measurement under this model yields H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=68.18±0.79 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, remaining in tension with several direct determination methods; the BAO data allow Hubble constant estimates that are robust against the assumption of the cosmological model. In addition, the BAO data allow estimates of H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; that are independent of the CMB data, with similar central values and precision under a ΛCDM model. Our most constraining combination of data gives the upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses at Σm&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;0.115 eV (95% confidence). Finally, we consider the improvements in cosmology constraints over the last decade by comparing our results to a sample representative of the period 2000-2010. We compute the relative gain across the five dimensions spanned by w, Ω&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, Σm&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and σ&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and find that the SDSS BAO and RSD data reduce the total posterior volume by a factor of 40 relative to the previous generation. Finally, adding again the Planck, DES, and Pantheon SN Ia samples leads to an overall contraction in the five-dimensional posterior volume of 3 orders of magnitude.",2021-04-28,2021,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevd.103.083533,1231,6,1.0,"['Shadab Alam', 'M Aubert', 'S.

World Inequality Report 2022,"World Inequality Report 2018 is the most authoritative and up-to-date account of global trends in inequality. Researched, compiled, and written by a team of the world's leading economists of inequality, it presents-with unrivaled clarity and depth-information and analysis that will be vital to policy makers and scholars everywhere. Inequality has taken center stage in public debate as the wealthiest people in most parts of the world have seen their share of the economy soar relative to that of others, many of whom, especially in the West, have experienced stagnation. The resulting political and social pressures have posed harsh new challenges for governments and created a pressing demand for reliable data. The World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics and the University of California, Berkeley, has answered this call by coordinating research into the latest trends in the accumulation and distribution of income and wealth on every continent. This inaugural report analyzes the Lab's findings, which include data from major countries where information has traditionally been difficult to acquire, such as China, India, and Brazil. Among nations, inequality has been decreasing as traditionally poor countries' economies have caught up with the West. The report shows, however, that inequality has been steadily deepening within almost every nation, though national trajectories vary, suggesting the importance of institutional and policy frameworks in shaping inequality. World Inequality Report 2018 will be a key document for anyone concerned about one of the most imperative and contentious subjects in contemporary politics and economics.",2022-11-07,2022,https://doi.org/10.4159/9780674276598,1229,-1,0.19554028602412205,[],,False
Green synthesis of nanoparticles: Current developments and limitations,"Nanoscale metals are widely used in many fields such as environment, medicine, and engineering that synthesis of nanoscale metals is a timely topic. At present, nanoscale metals are mainly synthesized by chemical methods that have unintended effects such as environmental pollution, large energy consumption, and potential health problems. In response to these challenges, green synthesis, which uses plant extracts instead of industrial chemical agents to reduce metal ions, has been developed. Green synthesis is more beneficial than traditional chemical synthesis because it costs less, decreases pollution, and improves environmental and human health safety. In this review, current developments in the green synthesis of nanoparticles of gold (Au NPs), silver (Ag NPs), palladium (Pd NPs), copper (Cu NPs), and iron and its oxide (Fe NPs) were evaluated. Major findings reveal the complexity in geographical and seasonal distributions of plants and their compositions that green synthesis is limited by time and place of production as well as issues with low purity and poor yield. However, considering current environmental problems and pollution associated with chemical synthesis, green synthesis offers alternative development prospects and potential applications.",2022-01-17,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2022.102336,1229,-1,0.3071572385704193,"['Shuaixuan Ying', 'Zhenru Guan', 'Polycarp C.

Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in machine learning: an introduction to concepts and methods,"Abstract The notion of uncertainty is of major importance in machine learning and constitutes a key element of machine learning methodology. In line with the statistical tradition, uncertainty has long been perceived as almost synonymous with standard probability and probabilistic predictions. Yet, due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications and related issues such as safety requirements, new problems and challenges have recently been identified by machine learning scholars, and these problems may call for new methodological developments. In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic . In this paper, we provide an introduction to the topic of uncertainty in machine learning as well as an overview of attempts so far at handling uncertainty in general and formalizing this distinction in particular.",2021-03-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-05946-3,1227,0,1.0,"['Eyke Hullermeier', 'Willem Waegeman', 'Eyke Hullermeier', 'Willem Waegeman']",,True
Trends and projections of caesarean section rates: global and regional estimates,"Background The caesarean section (CS) rate continues to increase across high-income, middle-income and low-income countries. We present current global and regional CS rates, trends since 1990 and projections for 2030. Methods We obtained nationally representative data on the CS rate from countries worldwide from 1990 to 2018. We used routine health information systems reports and population-based household surveys. Using the latest available data, we calculated current regional and subregional weighted averages. We estimated trends by a piecewise analysis of CS rates at the national, regional and global levels from 1990 to 2018. We projected the CS rate and the number of CS expected in 2030 using autoregressive integrated moving-average models. Results Latest available data (2010–2018) from 154 countries covering 94.5% of world live births shows that 21.1% of women gave birth by caesarean worldwide, averages ranging from 5% in sub-Saharan Africa to 42.8% in Latin America and the Caribbean. CS has risen in all regions since 1990. Subregions with the greatest increases were Eastern Asia, Western Asia and Northern Africa (44.9, 34.7 and 31.5 percentage point increase, respectively) while sub-Saharan Africa and Northern America (3.6 and 9.5 percentage point increase, respectively) had the lowest rise. Projections showed that by 2030, 28.5% of women worldwide will give birth by CS (38 million caesareans of which 33.5 million in LMIC annually) ranging from 7.1% in sub-Saharan Africa to 63.4% in Eastern Asia . Conclusion The use of CS has steadily increased worldwide and will continue increasing over the current decade where both unmet need and overuse are expected to coexist. In the absence of global effective interventions to revert the trend, Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa will face a complex scenario with morbidity and mortality associated with the unmet need, the unsafe provision of CS and with the concomitant overuse of the surgical procedure which drains resources and adds avoidable morbidity and mortality. If the Sustainable Development Goals are to be achieved, comprehensively addressing the CS issue is a global priority.",2021-06-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005671,1227,-1,0.3108798114193949,"['Ana Pilar Betrán', 'Jiangfeng Ye', 'Ann‐Beth Moller', 'João Paulo Souza', 'Jun Zhang']",,True
Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"Course selection is a crucial activity for students as it directly impacts their workload and performance. It is also time-consuming, prone to subjectivity, and often carried out based on incomplete information. This task can, nevertheless, be assisted with computational tools, for instance, by predicting performance based on historical data. We investigate the effects of showing grade predictions to students through an interactive visualization tool. A qualitative study suggests that in the presence of predictions, students may focus too much on maximizing their performance, to the detriment of other factors such as the workload. A follow-up quantitative study explored whether these effects are mitigated by changing how predictions are conveyed. Our observations suggest the presence of a framing effect that induces students to put more effort into course selection when faced with more specific predictions. We discuss these and other findings and outline considerations for designing better data-driven course selection tools.",2021-05-06,2021,https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764,1226,2,0.6987374552112529,"['Gonzalo Gabriel Méndez', 'Gonzalo Gabriel Méndez', 'Katherine Chiluiza']",,False

"Students’ voices on generative AI: perceptions, benefits, and challenges in higher education","Abstract This study explores university students’ perceptions of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, in higher education, focusing on familiarity, their willingness to engage, potential benefits and challenges, and effective integration. A survey of 399 undergraduate and postgraduate students from various disciplines in Hong Kong revealed a generally positive attitude towards GenAI in teaching and learning. Students recognized the potential for personalized learning support, writing and brainstorming assistance, and research and analysis capabilities. However, concerns about accuracy, privacy, ethical issues, and the impact on personal development, career prospects, and societal values were also expressed. According to John Biggs’ 3P model, student perceptions significantly influence learning approaches and outcomes. By understanding students’ perceptions, educators and policymakers can tailor GenAI technologies to address needs and concerns while promoting effective learning outcomes. Insights from this study can inform policy development around the integration of GenAI technologies into higher education. By understanding students’ perceptions and addressing their concerns, policymakers can create well-informed guidelines and strategies for the responsible and effective implementation of GenAI tools, ultimately enhancing teaching and learning experiences in higher education.",2023-07-16,2023,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41239-023-00411-8,1225,2,1.0,"['Cecilia Ka Yuk Chan', 'Wenjie Hu']",,True

"Cancer statistics, 2025","ABSTRACT Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population‐based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries (through 2021) and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (through 2022). In 2025, 2,041,910 new cancer cases and 618,120 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. The cancer mortality rate continued to decline through 2022, averting nearly 4.5 million deaths since 1991 because of smoking reductions, earlier detection for some cancers, and improved treatment. Yet alarming disparities persist; Native American people bear the highest cancer mortality, including rates that are two to three times those in White people for kidney, liver, stomach, and cervical cancers. Similarly, Black people have two‐fold higher mortality than White people for prostate, stomach, and uterine corpus cancers. Overall cancer incidence has generally declined in men but has risen in women, narrowing the male‐to‐female rate ratio (RR) from a peak of 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.57–1.61) in 1992 to 1.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.12–1.12) in 2021. However, rates in women aged 50–64 years have already surpassed those in men (832.5 vs. 830.6 per 100,000), and younger women (younger than 50 years) have an 82% higher incidence rate than their male counterparts (141.1 vs. 77.4 per 100,000), up from 51% in 2002. Notably, lung cancer incidence in women surpassed that in men among people younger than 65 years in 2021 (15.7 vs. 15.4 per 100,000; RR, 0.98, p = 0.03). In summary, cancer mortality continues to decline, but future gains are threatened by rampant racial inequalities and a growing burden of disease in middle‐aged and young adults, especially women. Continued progress will require investment in cancer prevention and access to equitable treatment, especially for Native American and Black individuals.",2025-01-01,2025,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21871,1222,3,0.418386489359542,"['Rebecca L.

Advances in immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent disease with a progression that is modulated by the immune system. Systemic therapy is used in the advanced stage and until 2017 consisted only of antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has shown strong anti-tumour activity in a subset of patients and the combination of the anti-PDL1 antibody atezolizumab and the VEGF-neutralizing antibody bevacizumab has or will soon become the standard of care as a first-line therapy for HCC, whereas the anti-PD1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab are used after TKIs in several regions. Other immune strategies such as adoptive T-cell transfer, vaccination or virotherapy have not yet demonstrated consistent clinical activity. Major unmet challenges in HCC checkpoint immunotherapy are the discovery and validation of predictive biomarkers, advancing treatment to earlier stages of the disease, applying the treatment to patients with liver dysfunction and the discovery of more effective combinatorial or sequential approaches. Combinations with other systemic or local treatments are perceived as the most promising opportunities in HCC and some are already under evaluation in large-scale clinical trials.

ERS/ATS technical standard on interpretive strategies for routine lung function tests,"Background Appropriate interpretation of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) involves the classification of observed values as within/outside the normal range based on a reference population of healthy individuals, integrating knowledge of physiological determinants of test results into functional classifications and integrating patterns with other clinical data to estimate prognosis. In 2005, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) jointly adopted technical standards for the interpretation of PFTs. We aimed to update the 2005 recommendations and incorporate evidence from recent literature to establish new standards for PFT interpretation. Methods This technical standards document was developed by an international joint Task Force, appointed by the ERS/ATS with multidisciplinary expertise in conducting and interpreting PFTs and developing international standards. A comprehensive literature review was conducted and published evidence was reviewed. Results Recommendations for the choice of reference equations and limits of normal of the healthy population to identify individuals with unusually low or high results are discussed. Interpretation strategies for bronchodilator responsiveness testing, limits of natural changes over time and severity are also updated. Interpretation of measurements made by spirometry, lung volumes and gas transfer are described as they relate to underlying pathophysiology with updated classification protocols of common impairments.

World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative,"Abstract Background falls and fall-related injuries are common in older adults, have negative effects on functional independence and quality of life and are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and health related costs. Current guidelines are inconsistent, with no up-to-date, globally applicable ones present. Objectives to create a set of evidence- and expert consensus-based falls prevention and management recommendations applicable to older adults for use by healthcare and other professionals that consider: (i) a person-centred approach that includes the perspectives of older adults with lived experience, caregivers and other stakeholders; (ii) gaps in previous guidelines; (iii) recent developments in e-health and (iv) implementation across locations with limited access to resources such as low- and middle-income countries. Methods a steering committee and a worldwide multidisciplinary group of experts and stakeholders, including older adults, were assembled. Geriatrics and gerontological societies were represented. Using a modified Delphi process, recommendations from 11 topic-specific working groups (WGs), 10 ad-hoc WGs and a WG dealing with the perspectives of older adults were reviewed and refined.

KEGG: biological systems database as a model of the real world,"Abstract KEGG (https://www.kegg.jp/) is a database resource for representation and analysis of biological systems. Pathway maps are the primary dataset in KEGG representing systemic functions of the cell and the organism in terms of molecular interaction and reaction networks. The KEGG Orthology (KO) system is a mechanism for linking genes and proteins to pathway maps and other molecular networks. Each KO is a generic gene identifier and each pathway map is created as a network of KO nodes. This architecture enables KEGG pathway mapping to uncover systemic features from KO assigned genomes and metagenomes. Additional roles of KOs include characterization of conserved genes and conserved units of genes in organism groups, which can be done by taxonomy mapping. A new tool has been developed for identifying conserved gene orders in chromosomes, in which gene orders are treated as sequences of KOs. Furthermore, a new dataset called VOG (virus ortholog group) is computationally generated from virus proteins and expanded to proteins of cellular organisms, allowing gene orders to be compared as VOG sequences as well. Together with these datasets and analysis tools, new types of pathway maps are being developed to present a global view of biological processes involving multiple organism groups.",2024-10-17,2024,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkae909,1214,5,0.7582412052237867,"['Minoru Kanehisa', 'Miho Furumichi', 'Yoko Sato', 'Yoshiharu Matsuura', 'Mari Ishiguro-Watanabe']",,True
Plant Flavonoids: Chemical Characteristics and Biological Activity,"In recent years, more attention has been paid to natural sources of antioxidants. Flavonoids are natural substances synthesized in several parts of plants that exhibit a high antioxidant capacity. They are a large family, presenting several classes based on their basic structure. Flavonoids have the ability to control the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via scavenger ROS when they are formed. Therefore, these antioxidant compounds have an important role in plant stress tolerance and a high relevance in human health, mainly due to their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. In addition, flavonoids have several applications in the food industry as preservatives, pigments, and antioxidants, as well as in other industries such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. However, flavonoids application for industrial purposes implies extraction processes with high purity and quality.

Foundation models for generalist medical artificial intelligence,"The exceptionally rapid development of highly flexible, reusable artificial intelligence (AI) models is likely to usher in newfound capabilities in medicine. We propose a new paradigm for medical AI, which we refer to as generalist medical AI (GMAI). GMAI models will be capable of carrying out a diverse set of tasks using very little or no task-specific labelled data. Built through self-supervision on large, diverse datasets, GMAI will flexibly interpret different combinations of medical modalities, including data from imaging, electronic health records, laboratory results, genomics, graphs or medical text. Models will in turn produce expressive outputs such as free-text explanations, spoken recommendations or image annotations that demonstrate advanced medical reasoning abilities. Here we identify a set of high-impact potential applications for GMAI and lay out specific technical capabilities and training datasets necessary to enable them. We expect that GMAI-enabled applications will challenge current strategies for regulating and validating AI devices for medicine and will shift practices associated with the collection of large medical datasets.",2023-04-12,2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-05881-4,1210,0,1.0,"['Michael Moor', 'Oishi Banerjee', 'Zahra Shakeri Hossein Abad', 'Harlan M.

Metabolic Syndrome: Updates on Pathophysiology and Management in 2021,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) forms a cluster of metabolic dysregulations including insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, central obesity, and hypertension. The pathogenesis of MetS encompasses multiple genetic and acquired entities that fall under the umbrella of insulin resistance and chronic low-grade inflammation. If left untreated, MetS is significantly associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Given that CVDs constitute by far the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, it has become essential to investigate the role played by MetS in this context to reduce the heavy burden of the disease. As such, and while MetS relatively constitutes a novel clinical entity, the extent of research about the disease has been exponentially growing in the past few decades. However, many aspects of this clinical entity are still not completely understood, and many questions remain unanswered to date.

"Abiotic Stress and Reactive Oxygen Species: Generation, Signaling, and Defense Mechanisms","Climate change is an invisible, silent killer with calamitous effects on living organisms. As the sessile organism, plants experience a diverse array of abiotic stresses during ontogenesis. The relentless climatic changes amplify the intensity and duration of stresses, making plants dwindle to survive. Plants convert 1–2% of consumed oxygen into reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular, singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide radical (O2•–), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (•OH), etc. as a byproduct of aerobic metabolism in different cell organelles such as chloroplast, mitochondria, etc. The regulatory network comprising enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems tends to keep the magnitude of ROS within plant cells to a non-damaging level. However, under stress conditions, the production rate of ROS increases exponentially, exceeding the potential of antioxidant scavengers instigating oxidative burst, which affects biomolecules and disturbs cellular redox homeostasis. ROS are similar to a double-edged sword; and, when present below the threshold level, mediate redox signaling pathways that actuate plant growth, development, and acclimatization against stresses. The production of ROS in plant cells displays both detrimental and beneficial effects. However, exact pathways of ROS mediated stress alleviation are yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore, the review deposits information about the status of known sites of production, signaling mechanisms/pathways, effects, and management of ROS within plant cells under stress. In addition, the role played by advancement in modern techniques such as molecular priming, systems biology, phenomics, and crop modeling in preventing oxidative stress, as well as diverting ROS into signaling pathways has been canvassed.",2021-02-11,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10020277,1207,-1,0.09159758520565847,"['Swati Sachdev', 'Shamim Akhtar Ansari', 'Mohammad Israil Ansari', 'Masayuki Fujita', 'Mirza Hasanuzzaman']",,True

The Triple-A Supply Chain,"Building a strong supply chain is essential for business success. But when it comes to improving their supply chains, few companies take the right approach. Many businesses work to make their chains faster or more cost-effective, assuming that those steps are the keys to competitive advantage. To the contrary: Supply chains that focus on speed and costs tend to deteriorate over time. The author has spent 15 years studying more than 60 companies to gain insight into this and other supply chain dilemmas. His conclusion: Only companies that build supply chains that are agile, adaptable, and aligned get ahead of their rivals. All three components are essential; without any one of them, supply chains break down. Great companies create supply chains that respond to abrupt changes in markets. Agility is critical because in most industries, both demand and supply fluctuate rapidly and widely. Supply chains typically cope by playing speed against costs, but agile ones respond both quickly and cost-efficiently. Great companies also adapt their supply networks when markets or strategies change. The best supply chains allow managers to identify structural shifts early by recording the latest data, filtering out noise, and tracking key patterns. Finally, great companies align the interests of the partners in their supply chains with their own. That's important because every firm is concerned solely with its own interests. If its goals are out of alignment with those of other partners in the supply chain, performance will suffer. When companies hear about the triple-A supply chain, they assume that building one will require increased technology and investment. But most firms already have the infrastructure in place to create one. A fresh attitude alone can go a long way toward making it happen.",2024-04-11,2024,https://doi.org/10.58140/gsb-6021,1205,-1,0.17887510653426897,['Hau L. Lee'],,True

A simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations,"This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of
visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive
self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures

prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the
major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data
augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2)
introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and
the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned
representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes
and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these
findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for
self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier
trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5%
top-1 accuracy, which is a 7% relative improvement over previous

Charlson Comorbidity Index: A Critical Review of Clinimetric Properties,"The present critical review was conducted to evaluate the clinimetric properties of the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), an assessment tool designed specifically to predict long-term mortality, with regard to its reliability, concurrent validity, sensitivity, incremental and predictive validity. The original version of the CCI has been adapted for use with different sources of data, ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. The inter-rater reliability of the CCI was found to be excellent, with extremely high agreement between self-report and medical charts. The CCI has also been shown either to have concurrent validity with a number of other prognostic scales or to result in concordant predictions. Importantly, the clinimetric sensitivity of the CCI has been demonstrated in a variety of medical conditions, with stepwise increases in the CCI associated with stepwise increases in mortality. The CCI is also characterized by the clinimetric property of incremental validity, whereby adding the CCI to other measures increases the overall predictive accuracy. It has been shown to predict long-term mortality in different clinical populations, including medical, surgical, intensive care unit (ICU), trauma, and cancer patients. It may also predict in-hospital mortality, although in some instances, such as ICU or trauma patients, the CCI did not perform as well as other instruments designed specifically for that purpose. The CCI thus appears to be clinically useful not only to provide a valid assessment of the patient’s unique clinical situation, but also to demarcate major diagnostic and prognostic differences among subgroups of patients sharing the same medical diagnosis.",2022-01-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1159/000521288,1194,1,0.7856636885830836,"['Mary E.

ESHRE guideline: endometriosis,"Abstract STUDY QUESTION How should endometriosis be diagnosed and managed based on the best available evidence from published literature? SUMMARY ANSWER The current guideline provides 109 recommendations on diagnosis, treatments for pain and infertility, management of disease recurrence, asymptomatic or extrapelvic disease, endometriosis in adolescents and postmenopausal women, prevention and the association with cancer. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Endometriosis is a chronic condition with a plethora of presentations in terms of not only the occurrence of lesions, but also the presence of signs and symptoms. The most important symptoms include pain and infertility. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION The guideline was developed according to the structured methodology for development of ESHRE guidelines. After formulation of key questions by a group of experts, literature searches and assessments were performed. Papers published up to 1 December 2020 and written in English were included in the literature review. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Based on the collected evidence, recommendations were formulated and discussed within specialist subgroups and then presented to the core guideline development group (GDG) until consensus was reached. A stakeholder review was organized after finalization of the draft. The final version was approved by the GDG and the ESHRE Executive Committee. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE This guideline aims to help clinicians to apply best care for women with endometriosis. Although studies mostly focus on women of reproductive age, the guideline also addresses endometriosis in adolescents and postmenopausal women. The guideline outlines the diagnostic process for endometriosis, which challenges laparoscopy and histology as gold standard diagnostic tests. The options for treatment of endometriosis-associated pain symptoms include analgesics, medical treatments and surgery. Non-pharmacological treatments are also discussed. For management of endometriosis-associated infertility, surgical treatment and/or medically assisted reproduction are feasible. While most of the more recent studies confirm previous ESHRE recommendations, there are five topics in which significant changes to recommendations were required and changes in clinical practice are to be expected. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The guideline describes different management options but, based on existing evidence, no firm recommendations could be formulated on the most appropriate treatments. Also, for specific clinical issues, such as asymptomatic endometriosis or extrapelvic endometriosis, the evidence is too scarce to make evidence-based recommendations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The guideline provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice in endometriosis care, based on the best evidence currently available. In addition, a list of research recommendations is provided to stimulate further studies in endometriosis. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S) The guideline was developed and funded by ESHRE, covering expenses associated with the guideline meetings, with the literature searches and with the dissemination of the guideline.

Tremelimumab plus Durvalumab in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: A single, high priming dose of tremelimumab (anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen 4) plus durvalumab (anti–programmed cell death ligand-1), an infusion regimen termed STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab), showed encouraging clinical activity and safety in a phase 2 trial of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: In this global, open-label, phase 3 trial, the majority of the patients we enrolled with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and no previous systemic treatment were randomly assigned to receive one of three regimens: tremelimumab (300 mg, one dose) plus durvalumab (1500 mg every 4 weeks; STRIDE), durvalumab (1500 mg every 4 weeks), or sorafenib (400 mg twice daily). The primary objective was overall survival for STRIDE versus sorafenib. Noninferiority for overall survival for durvalumab versus sorafenib was a secondary objective. RESULTS: In total, 1171 patients were randomly assigned to STRIDE (n=393), durvalumab (n=389), or sorafenib (n=389). The median overall survival was 16.43 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.16 to 19.58) with STRIDE, 16.56 months (95% CI, 14.06 to 19.12) with durvalumab, and 13.77 months (95% CI, 12.25 to 16.13) with sorafenib. Overall survival at 36 months was 30.7%, 24.7%, and 20.2%, respectively. The overall survival hazard ratio for STRIDE versus sorafenib was 0.78 (96.02% CI, 0.65 to 0.93; P=0.0035). Overall survival with durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95.67% CI, 0.73 to 1.03; noninferiority margin, 1.08). Median progression-free survival was not significantly different among all three groups. Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred for 50.5% of patients with STRIDE, 37.1% with durvalumab, and 52.4% with sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: STRIDE significantly improved overall survival versus sorafenib. Durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

Scaling Up Visual and Vision-Language Representation Learning With Noisy Text Supervision,"Pre-trained representations are becoming crucial for many NLP and perception tasks. While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw text without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations still rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require expert knowledge. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned using datasets with explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For vision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all involve a non-trivial data collection (and cleaning) process. This costly curation process limits the size of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of trained models. In this paper, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion image alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing steps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple dual-encoder architecture learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs using a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for its noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even with such a simple learning scheme. Our visual representation achieves strong performance when transferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned visual and language representations enables zero-shot image classification and also set new state-of-the-art results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO image-text retrieval benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated cross-attention models. The representations also enable cross-modality search with complex text and text + image queries.",2021-02-11,2021,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2102.05918,1190,0,0.533314397536438,"['Chao Jia', 'Yinfei Yang', 'Ye Xia', 'Yi‐Ting Chen', 'Zarana Parekh', 'Hieu Pham', 'Quoc V.

The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation. The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation.

Machine learning for combinatorial optimization: A methodological tour d'horizon,"This paper surveys the recent attempts, both from the machine learning and operations research communities, at leveraging machine learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Given the hard nature of these problems, state-of-the-art algorithms rely on handcrafted heuristics for making decisions that are otherwise too expensive to compute or mathematically not well defined.

Environmental stress destabilizes microbial networks,"Abstract Environmental stress is increasing worldwide, yet we lack a clear picture of how stress disrupts the stability of microbial communities and the ecosystem services they provide. Here, we present the first evidence that naturally-occurring microbiomes display network properties characteristic of unstable communities when under persistent stress. By assessing changes in diversity and structure of soil microbiomes along 40 replicate stress gradients (elevation/water availability gradients) in the Florida scrub ecosystem, we show that: (1) prokaryotic and fungal diversity decline in high stress, and (2) two network properties of stable microbial communities—modularity and negative:positive cohesion—have a clear negative relationship with environmental stress, explaining 51–78% of their variation. Interestingly, pathogenic taxa/functional guilds decreased in relative abundance along the stress gradient, while oligotrophs and mutualists increased, suggesting that the shift in negative:positive cohesion could result from decreasing negative:positive biotic interactions consistent with the predictions of the Stress Gradient Hypothesis. Given the crucial role microbiomes play in ecosystem functions, our results suggest that, by limiting the compartmentalization of microbial associations and creating communities dominated by positive associations, increasing stress in the Anthropocene could destabilize microbiomes and undermine their ecosystem services.",2021-01-15,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-020-00882-x,1183,-1,0.17541170113215163,"['Damian J.

Efficient Multi-Scale Attention Module with Cross-Spatial Learning,"Remarkable effectiveness of the channel or spatial attention mechanisms for producing more discernible feature representation are illustrated in various computer vision tasks. However, modeling the cross-channel relationships with channel dimensionality reduction may bring side effect in extracting deep visual representations. In this paper, a novel efficient multi-scale attention (EMA) module is proposed. Focusing on retaining the information on per channel and decreasing the computational overhead, we reshape the partly channels into the batch dimensions and group the channel dimensions into multiple sub-features which make the spatial semantic features well-distributed inside each feature group. Specifically, apart from encoding the global information to re-calibrate the channel-wise weight in each parallel branch, the output features of the two parallel branches are further aggregated by a cross-dimension interaction for capturing pixel-level pairwise relationship. We conduct extensive ablation studies and experiments on image classification and object detection tasks with popular benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, MS COCO and VisDrone2019) for evaluating its performance.",2023-05-05,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/icassp49357.2023.10096516,1181,0,1.0,"['Daliang Ouyang', 'Su He', 'Guozhong Zhang', 'Mingzhu Luo', 'Huaiyong Guo', 'Jianming Zhan', 'Zhijie Huang']",,True

Benchmarking atlas-level data integration in single-cell genomics,"Abstract Single-cell atlases often include samples that span locations, laboratories and conditions, leading to complex, nested batch effects in data. Thus, joint analysis of atlas datasets requires reliable data integration. To guide integration method choice, we benchmarked 68 method and preprocessing combinations on 85 batches of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and simulation data from 23 publications, altogether representing &gt;1.2 million cells distributed in 13 atlas-level integration tasks. We evaluated methods according to scalability, usability and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation using 14 evaluation metrics. We show that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration methods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, scANVI, Scanorama, scVI and scGen perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks, while single-cell ATAC-sequencing integration performance is strongly affected by choice of feature space.

Global prevalence of sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia: a systematic review and meta‐analysis,"Abstract Background Sarcopenia is defined as the loss of muscle mass and strength. Despite the seriousness of this disease, a single diagnostic criterion has not yet been established. Few studies have reported the prevalence of sarcopenia globally, and there is a high level of heterogeneity between studies, stemmed from the diagnostic criteria of sarcopenia and the target population. The aims of this systematic review and meta‐analysis were (i) to identify and summarize the diagnostic criteria used to define sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia and (ii) to estimate the global and region‐specific prevalence of sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia by sociodemographic factors. Methods Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science Core Collections were searched using relevant MeSH terms. The inclusion criteria were cross‐sectional or cohort studies in individuals aged ≥18 years, published in English, and with muscle mass measured using dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry, bioelectrical impedance, or computed tomography (CT) scan. For the meta‐analysis, studies were stratified by diagnostic criteria (classifications), cut‐off points, and instruments to assess muscle mass. If at least three studies reported the same classification, cut‐off points, and instrument to measure muscle mass, they were considered suitable for meta‐analysis. Following this approach, 6 classifications and 23 subgroups were created. Overall pooled estimates with inverse‐variance weights obtained from a random‐effects model were estimated using the metaprop command in Stata. Results Out of 19 320 studies, 263 were eligible for the narrative synthesis and 151 for meta‐analysis (total n = 692 056, mean age: 68.5 years). Using different classifications and cut‐off points, the prevalence of sarcopenia varied between 10% and 27% in the studies included for meta‐analysis. The highest and lowest prevalence were observed in Oceania and Europe using the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) and EWGSOP2, respectively. The prevalence ranged from 8% to 36% in individuals &lt;60 years and from 10% to 27% in ≥60 years. Men had a higher prevalence of sarcopenia using the EWGSOP2 (11% vs. 2%) while it was higher in women using the International Working Group on Sarcopenia (17% vs. 12%). Finally, the prevalence of severe sarcopenia ranged from 2% to 9%. Conclusions The prevalence of sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia varied considerably according to the classification and cut‐off point used. Considering the lack of a single diagnostic for sarcopenia, future studies should adhere to current guidelines, which would facilitate the comparison of results between studies and populations across the globe.",2021-11-23,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcsm.12783,1179,1,0.2642166027493279,"['Fanny Petermann‐Rocha', 'Viktoria Balntzi', 'Stuart R.

Integrated photonics on thin-film lithium niobate,"Lithium niobate (LN), an outstanding and versatile material, has influenced our daily life for decades—from enabling high-speed optical communications that form the backbone of the Internet to realizing radio-frequency filtering used in our cell phones. This half-century-old material is currently embracing a revolution in thin-film LN integrated photonics. The successes of manufacturing wafer-scale, high-quality thin films of LN-on-insulator (LNOI) and breakthroughs in nanofabrication techniques have made high-performance integrated nanophotonic components possible. With rapid development in the past few years, some of these thin-film LN devices, such as optical modulators and nonlinear wavelength converters, have already outperformed their legacy counterparts realized in bulk LN crystals. Furthermore, the nanophotonic integration has enabled ultra-low-loss resonators in LN, which has unlocked many novel applications such as optical frequency combs and quantum transducers. In this review, we cover—from basic principles to the state of the art—the diverse aspects of integrated thin-film LN photonics, including the materials, basic passive components, and various active devices based on electro-optics, all-optical nonlinearities, and acousto-optics.

Nanomaterial by Sol‐Gel Method: Synthesis and Application,"The sol‐gel process is a more chemical method (wet chemical method) for the synthesis of various nanostructures, especially metal oxide nanoparticles. In this method, the molecular precursor (usually metal alkoxide) is dissolved in water or alcohol and converted to gel by heating and stirring by hydrolysis/alcoholysis. Since the gel obtained from the hydrolysis/alcoholysis process is wet or damp, it should be dried using appropriate methods depending on the desired properties and application of the gel. For example, if it is an alcoholic solution, the drying process is done by burning alcohol. After the drying stage, the produced gels are powdered and then calcined. The sol‐gel method is a cost‐effective method and due to the low reaction temperature there is good control over the chemical composition of the products. The sol‐gel method can be used in the process of making ceramics as a molding material and can be used as an intermediate between thin films of metal oxides in various applications. The materials obtained from the sol‐gel method are used in various optical, electronic, energy, surface engineering, biosensors, and pharmaceutical and separation technologies (such as chromatography). The sol‐gel method is a conventional and industrial method for the synthesis of nanoparticles with different chemical composition. The basis of the sol‐gel method is the production of a homogeneous sol from the precursors and its conversion into a gel. The solvent in the gel is then removed from the gel structure and the remaining gel is dried. The properties of the dried gel depend significantly on the drying method. In other words, the “removing solvent method” is selected according to the application in which the gel will be used. Dried gels in various ways are used in industries such as surface coating, building insulation, and the production of special clothing. It is worth mentioning that, by grinding the gel by special mills, it is possible to achieve nanoparticles.",2021-01-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5102014,1173,4,1.0,"['Dmitry Olegovich Bokov', 'Abduladheem Turki Jalil', 'Supat Chupradit', 'Wanich Suksatan', 'Mohammad Javed Ansari', 'Iman H.

For instance, Flan-PaLM 540B instruction-finetuned on 1.8K tasks outperforms PALM 540B by a large margin (+9.4% on average). Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2% on five-shot MMLU.

The Impact of Climate Change on Agricultural Insect Pests,"Climate change and global warming are of great concern to agriculture worldwide and are among the most discussed issues in today’s society. Climate parameters such as increased temperatures, rising atmospheric CO2 levels, and changing precipitation patterns have significant impacts on agricultural production and on agricultural insect pests. Changes in climate can affect insect pests in several ways. They can result in an expansion of their geographic distribution, increased survival during overwintering, increased number of generations, altered synchrony between plants and pests, altered interspecific interaction, increased risk of invasion by migratory pests, increased incidence of insect-transmitted plant diseases, and reduced effectiveness of biological control, especially natural enemies. As a result, there is a serious risk of crop economic losses, as well as a challenge to human food security. As a major driver of pest population dynamics, climate change will require adaptive management strategies to deal with the changing status of pests. Several priorities can be identified for future research on the effects of climatic changes on agricultural insect pests.

Receiver operating characteristic curve: overview and practical use for clinicians,"Using diagnostic testing to determine the presence or absence of a disease is essential in clinical practice. In many cases, test results are obtained as continuous values and require a process of conversion and interpretation and into a dichotomous form to determine the presence of a disease. The primary method used for this process is the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve is used to assess the overall diagnostic performance of a test and to compare the performance of two or more diagnostic tests. It is also used to select an optimal cut-off value for determining the presence or absence of a disease. Although clinicians who do not have expertise in statistics do not need to understand both the complex mathematical equation and the analytic process of ROC curves, understanding the core concepts of the ROC curve analysis is a prerequisite for the proper use and interpretation of the ROC curve. This review describes the basic concepts for the correct use and interpretation of the ROC curve, including parametric/nonparametric ROC curves, the meaning of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), the partial AUC, methods for selecting the best cut-off value, and the statistical software to use for ROC curve analyses.",2022-01-18,2022,https://doi.org/10.4097/kja.21209,1170,1,1.0,['Francis Sahngun Nahm'],,True

Conditional Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models,"With the rise of powerful pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP, it becomes essential to investigate ways to adapt these models to downstream datasets. A recently proposed method named Context Optimization (CoOp) introduces the concept of prompt learning—a recent trend in NLP—to the vision domain for adapting pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, CoOp turns context words in a prompt into a set of learnable vectors and, with only a few labeled images for learning, can achieve huge improvements over intensively-tuned manual prompts. In our study we identify a critical problem of CoOp: the learned context is not generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset, suggesting that CoOp overfits base classes observed during training. To address the problem, we propose Conditional Context Optimization (CoCoOp), which extends CoOp by further learning a lightweight neural network to generate for each image an input-conditional token (vector). Compared to CoOp's static prompts, our dynamic prompts adapt to each instance and are thus less sensitive to class shift.

A Brief History of OLEDs—Emitter Development and Industry Milestones,"Abstract Organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) have come a long way ever since their first introduction in 1987 at Eastman Kodak. Today, OLEDs are especially valued in the display and lighting industry for their promising features. As one of the research fields that equally inspires and drives development in academia and industry, OLED device technology has continuously evolved over more than 30 years. OLED devices have come forward based on three generations of emitter materials relying on fluorescence (first generation), phosphorescence (second generation), and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (third generation). Furthermore, research in academia and industry toward the fourth generation of OLEDs is in progress. Excerpts from the history of green, orange‐red, and blue OLED emitter development on the side of academia and milestones achieved by key players in the industry are included in this report.",2021-01-18,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202005630,1163,4,0.4349742971517315,"['Gloria Hong', 'Xuemin Gan', 'Céline Leonhardt', 'Zhen Zhang', 'Jasmin Seibert', 'Jasmin M.

Self-supervised Graph Learning for Recommendation,"Representation learning on user-item graph for recommendation has evolved\nfrom using single ID or interaction history to exploiting higher-order\nneighbors. This leads to the success of graph convolution networks (GCNs) for\nrecommendation such as PinSage and LightGCN. Despite effectiveness, we argue\nthat they suffer from two limitations: (1) high-degree nodes exert larger\nimpact on the representation learning, deteriorating the recommendations of\nlow-degree (long-tail) items; and (2) representations are vulnerable to noisy\ninteractions, as the neighborhood aggregation scheme further enlarges the\nimpact of observed edges.\n In this work, we explore self-supervised learning on user-item graph, so as\nto improve the accuracy and robustness of GCNs for recommendation. The idea is\nto supplement the classical supervised task of recommendation with an auxiliary\nself-supervised task, which reinforces node representation learning via\nself-discrimination. Specifically, we generate multiple views of a node,\nmaximizing the agreement between different views of the same node compared to\nthat of other nodes. We devise three operators to generate the views -- node\ndropout, edge dropout, and random walk -- that change the graph structure in\ndifferent manners. We term this new learning paradigm as\n\\textit{Self-supervised Graph Learning} (SGL), implementing it on the\nstate-of-the-art model LightGCN. Through theoretical analyses, we find that SGL\nhas the ability of automatically mining hard negatives. Empirical studies on\nthree benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SGL, which improves\nthe recommendation accuracy, especially on long-tail items, and the robustness\nagainst interaction noises.

Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance: The Most Critical Pathogens,"Antibiotics have made it possible to treat bacterial infections such as meningitis and bacteraemia that, prior to their introduction, were untreatable and consequently fatal. Unfortunately, in recent decades overuse and misuse of antibiotics as well as social and economic factors have accelerated the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making drug treatment ineffective. Currently, at least 700,000 people worldwide die each year due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Without new and better treatments, the World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that this number could rise to 10 million by 2050, highlighting a health concern not of secondary importance. In February 2017, in light of increasing antibiotic resistance, the WHO published a list of pathogens that includes the pathogens designated by the acronym ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) to which were given the highest “priority status” since they represent the great threat to humans. Understanding the resistance mechanisms of these bacteria is a key step in the development of new antimicrobial drugs to tackle drug-resistant bacteria. In this review, both the mode of action and the mechanisms of resistance of commonly used antimicrobials will be examined. It also discusses the current state of AMR in the most critical resistant bacteria as determined by the WHO’s global priority pathogens list.",2021-10-12,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10101310,1160,1,1.0,"['Giuseppe Mancuso', 'Angelina Midiri', 'Elisabetta Gerace', 'Carmelo Biondo']",,True

Copper homeostasis and cuproptosis in health and disease,"Abstract As an essential micronutrient, copper is required for a wide range of physiological processes in virtually all cell types. Because the accumulation of intracellular copper can induce oxidative stress and perturbing cellular function, copper homeostasis is tightly regulated. Recent studies identified a novel copper-dependent form of cell death called cuproptosis, which is distinct from all other known pathways underlying cell death. Cuproptosis occurs via copper binding to lipoylated enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which leads to subsequent protein aggregation, proteotoxic stress, and ultimately cell death. Here, we summarize our current knowledge regarding copper metabolism, copper-related disease, the characteristics of cuproptosis, and the mechanisms that regulate cuproptosis. In addition, we discuss the implications of cuproptosis in the pathogenesis of various disease conditions, including Wilson’s disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, and we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting cuproptosis.",2022-11-23,2022,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-022-01229-y,1153,3,1.0,"['Liyun Chen', 'Junxia Min', 'Fudi Wang']",,True

Applied Ecology and Environmental Research,"This work presents indicators to assess the conservation status of forest patches in fragmented landscapes. However, how can we evaluate the conservation status of forest patches in order to compare it to a hypothetical situation of well-preserved vegetation without human disturbance? It is possible to measure some ecological processes, like nutrient cycling, canopy, edaphic, topographic and hydrological parameters, as well as landscape attributes, and associate them to conservation status. When the attributes of original well-preserved forest are unknown because they are seldom found, it is possible to compare patches by assessing the variability of their attributes. To this end, parameters related to canopy, soil, topography and landscape were analyzed to establish indicators and their integrated analysis was developed to assess the conservation status of forest patches and identify possible causes of shortcomings or obstacles to reach the conservation status. The study area is located in a Semidecidual Forest region, in Brazil. The methodology was developed considering plots distributed in sites within forest patches. The results allowed the identification of patches in different conditions of conservation and provided information of the factors that contribute to this status, in order to help guide and select the most appropriate measures to mitigate degradation and identify forest conservation strategies.",2025-12-04,2025,https://doi.org/10.15666/aeer,1152,2,0.4994690653190744,"['Maboeta', 'L. van Rensburg', 'Peet Jansen van Rensburg']",,True

On Intersectionality: Essential Writings,"For more than twenty years, scholars, activists, educators, and lawyers – inside and outside of the United States – have employed the concept of intersectionality both to describe problems of inequality and to fashion concrete solutions. In particular, as the Washington Post reported recently, “the term has been used by social activists as both a rallying cry for more expansive progressive movements and a chastisement for their limitations.” Drawing on black feminist and critical legal theory, Kimberlé Crenshaw developed the concept of intersectionality, a term she coined to speak to the multiple social forces, social identities, and ideological instruments through which power and disadvantage are expressed and legitimized.\nIn this comprehensive and accessible introduction to Crenshaw’s work, readers will find key essays and articles that have defined the concept of intersectionality, collected together for the first time.

Scaling Up Your Kernels to 31×31: Revisiting Large Kernel Design in CNNs,"We revisit large kernel design in modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Inspired by recent advances in vision transformers (ViTs), in this paper, we demonstrate that using a few large convolutional kernels instead of a stack of small kernels could be a more powerful paradigm. We suggested five guidelines, e.g., applying re-parameterized large depthwise convolutions, to design efficient high-performance large-kernel CNNs. Following the guidelines, we propose RepLKNet, a pure CNN architecture whose kernel size is as large as 31×31, in contrast to commonly used 3×3. RepLKNet greatly closes the performance gap between CNNs and ViTs, e.g., achieving comparable or superior results than Swin Transformer on ImageNet and a few typical downstream tasks, with lower latency. RepLKNet also shows nice scalability to big data and large models, obtaining 87.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and 56.0% mIoU on ADE20K, which is very competitive among the state-of-the-arts with similar model sizes. Our study further reveals that, in contrast to small-kernel CNNs, large-kernel CNNs have much larger effective receptive fields and higher shape bias rather than texture bias.

IOBR: Multi-Omics Immuno-Oncology Biological Research to Decode Tumor Microenvironment and Signatures,"Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have triggered the rapid accumulation of publicly available multi-omics datasets. The application of integrated omics to explore robust signatures for clinical translation is increasingly emphasized, and this is attributed to the clinical success of immune checkpoint blockades in diverse malignancies. However, effective tools for comprehensively interpreting multi-omics data are still warranted to provide increased granularity into the intrinsic mechanism of oncogenesis and immunotherapeutic sensitivity. Therefore, we developed a computational tool for effective Immuno-Oncology Biological Research (IOBR), providing a comprehensive investigation of the estimation of reported or user-built signatures, TME deconvolution, and signature construction based on multi-omics data. Notably, IOBR offers batch analyses of these signatures and their correlations with clinical phenotypes, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) profiling, genomic characteristics, and signatures generated from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in different cancer settings.

Towards Robust Monocular Depth Estimation: Mixing Datasets for Zero-shot Cross-dataset Transfer,"The success of monocular depth estimation relies on large and diverse training sets. Due to the challenges associated with acquiring dense ground-truth depth across different environments at scale, a number of datasets with distinct characteristics and biases have emerged. We develop tools that enable mixing multiple datasets during training, even if their annotations are incompatible. In particular, we propose a robust training objective that is invariant to changes in depth range and scale, advocate the use of principled multi-objective learning to combine data from different sources, and highlight the importance of pretraining encoders on auxiliary tasks. Armed with these tools, we experiment with six diverse training datasets, including a new, massive data source: 3D films. To demonstrate the generalization power of our approach we use zero-shot cross-dataset transfer, i.e. we evaluate on datasets that were not seen during training. The experiments confirm that mixing data from complementary sources greatly improves monocular depth estimation. Our approach clearly outperforms competing methods across diverse datasets, setting a new state of the art for monocular depth estimation.",2022-03-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000462024,1149,0,0.5884735586908943,"['René Ranftl', 'Katrin Lasinger', 'David Hafner', 'Konrad Schindler', 'Vladlen Koltun']",,True

Updated methodological guidance for the conduct of scoping reviews,"ABSTRACT Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe the updated methodological guidance for conducting a JBI scoping review, with a focus on new updates to the approach and development of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (the PRISMA-ScR). Introduction: Scoping reviews are an increasingly common approach to informing decision-making and research based on the identification and examination of the literature on a given topic or issue. Scoping reviews draw on evidence from any research methodology and may also include evidence from non-research sources, such as policy. In this manner, scoping reviews provide a comprehensive overview to address broader review questions than traditionally more specific systematic reviews of effectiveness or qualitative evidence. The increasing popularity of scoping reviews has been accompanied by the development of a reporting guideline: the PRISMA-ScR. In 2014, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group developed guidance for scoping reviews that received minor updates in 2017 and was most recently updated in 2020. The updates reflect ongoing and substantial developments in approaches to scoping review conduct and reporting. As such, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group recognized the need to revise the guidance to align with the current state of knowledge and reporting standards in evidence synthesis. Methods: Between 2015 and 2020, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group expanded its membership; extensively reviewed the literature; engaged via annual face-to-face meetings, regular teleconferences, and email correspondence; sought advice from methodological experts; facilitated workshops; and presented at scientific conferences. This process led to updated guidance for scoping reviews published in the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis . The updated chapter was endorsed by JBI's International Scientific Committee in 2020. Results: The updated JBI guidance for scoping reviews includes additional guidance on several methodological issues, such as when a scoping review is (or is not) appropriate, and how to extract, analyze, and present results, and provides clarification for implications for practice and research. Furthermore, it is aligned with the PRISMA-ScR to ensure consistent reporting. Conclusions: The latest JBI guidance for scoping reviews provides up-to-date guidance that can be used by authors when conducting a scoping review. Furthermore, it aligns with the PRISMA-ScR, which can be used to report the conduct of a scoping review. A series of ongoing and future methodological projects identified by the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group to further refine the methodology are planned.",2021-03-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1097/xeb.0000000000000277,1148,2,0.3011933231742642,"['Micah D.J.

Dual u-net with resnet encoder for segmentation of medical images,"Segmentation of medical images has been the most demanding and growing area currently for analysis of medical images. Segmentation of polyp images is a huge challenge because of the variability of color depth and morphology in polyps throughout colonoscopy imaging. For segmentation, in this work, we have used a dataset of images of the gastrointestinal polyp. The algorithms used in this paper for segmentation of gastrointestinal polyp images depend on profound deep convolutional neural network architectures: FCN, Dual U-net with Resnet Encoder, U-net, and Unet_Resnet. To improve the performance, data augmentation is performed on the dataset. The efficiency of the algorithms is measured by using metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection Over Union (IOU). The algorithm Dual U-net with Resnet Encoder obtains a higher DSC of 0.87 and IOU of 0.80 and beats the other algorithms U-net, FCN, and Unet_Resnet in segmentation of gastrointestinal polyp images.",2022-12-30,2022,,1148,0,0.5421548596629546,"['Mohammad Fasha', 'Bassam Hammo', 'Nadim Obeid', 'Jabir Widian']",,False

Outside the Safe Operating Space of the Planetary Boundary for Novel Entities,"We submit that the safe operating space of the planetary boundary of novel entities is exceeded since annual production and releases are increasing at a pace that outstrips the global capacity for assessment and monitoring. The novel entities boundary in the planetary boundaries framework refers to entities that are novel in a geological sense and that could have large-scale impacts that threaten the integrity of Earth system processes. We review the scientific literature relevant to quantifying the boundary for novel entities and highlight plastic pollution as a particular aspect of high concern. An impact pathway from production of novel entities to impacts on Earth system processes is presented. We define and apply three criteria for assessment of the suitability of control variables for the boundary: feasibility, relevance, and comprehensiveness. We propose several complementary control variables to capture the complexity of this boundary, while acknowledging major data limitations. We conclude that humanity is currently operating outside the planetary boundary based on the weight-of-evidence for several of these control variables. The increasing rate of production and releases of larger volumes and higher numbers of novel entities with diverse risk potentials exceed societies' ability to conduct safety related assessments and monitoring. We recommend taking urgent action to reduce the harm associated with exceeding the boundary by reducing the production and releases of novel entities, noting that even so, the persistence of many novel entities and/or their associated effects will continue to pose a threat.",2022-01-18,2022,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c04158,1146,-1,0.46109210673164974,"['Linn Persson', 'Bethanie Carney Almroth', 'Chris D.

Immune correlates analysis of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine efficacy clinical trial,"Antibody levels predict vaccine efficacy Symptomatic COVID-19 infection can be prevented by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines. A “correlate of protection” is a molecular biomarker to measure how much immunity is needed to fight infection and is key for successful global immunization programs. Gilbert et al . determined that antibodies are the correlate of protection in vaccinated individuals enrolled in the Moderna COVE phase 3 clinical trial (see the Perspective by Openshaw). By measuring binding and neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein, the authors found that the levels of both antibodies correlated with the degree of vaccine efficacy. The higher the antibody level, the greater the protection afforded by the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine. Antibody levels that predict mRNA vaccine efficacy can therefore be used to guide vaccine regimen modifications and support regulatory approvals for a broader spectrum of the population. —PNK",2022-01-06,2022,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm3425,1145,1,0.44480255420405257,"['Peter B.

Detection of microplastics in human lung tissue using μFTIR spectroscopy,"Airborne microplastics (MPs) have been sampled globally, and their concentration is known to increase in areas of high human population and activity, especially indoors. Respiratory symptoms and disease following exposure to occupational levels of MPs within industry settings have also been reported. It remains to be seen whether MPs from the environment can be inhaled, deposited and accumulated within the human lungs. This study analysed digested human lung tissue samples (n = 13) using μFTIR spectroscopy (size limitation of 3 μm) to detect and characterise any MPs present. In total, 39 MPs were identified within 11 of the 13 lung tissue samples with an average of 1.42 ± 1.50 MP/g of tissue (expressed as 0.69 ± 0.84 MP/g after background subtraction adjustments). The MP levels within tissue samples were significantly higher than those identified within combined procedural/laboratory blanks (n = 9 MPs, with a mean ± SD of 0.53 ± 1.07, p = 0.001). Of the MPs detected, 12 polymer types were identified with polypropylene, PP (23%), polyethylene terephthalate, PET (18%) and resin (15%) the most abundant. MPs (unadjusted) were identified within all regions of the lung categorised as upper (0.80 ± 0.96 MP/g), middle/lingular (0.41 ± 0.37 MP/g), and with significantly higher levels detected in the lower (3.12 ± 1.30 MP/g) region compared with the upper (p = 0.026) and mid (p = 0.038) lung regions. After subtracting blanks, these levels became 0.23 ± 0.28, 0.33 ± 0.37 and 1.65 ± 0.88 MP/g respectively. The study demonstrates the highest level of contamination control and reports unadjusted values alongside different contamination adjustment techniques. These results support inhalation as a route of exposure for environmental MPs, and this characterisation of types and levels can now inform realistic conditions for laboratory exposure experiments, with the aim of determining health impacts.",2022-03-29,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154907,1142,-1,0.14566837952517941,"['Lauren C.

Capturing the impact of COVID-19 on construction projects in developing countries: a case study of Iraq,"&lt;p&gt;The outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted construction markets worldwide due to supply chain disruptions, workforce restrictions, and legislative changes. However, construction markets in developing countries are perceived to be more vulnerable to the challenges associated with the pandemic. As such, the goal of this paper is to capture the impact of COVID-19 on construction projects in developing countries by considering the case of the Iraqi construction sector. A multistep research methodology was adopted by the authors, including (1) literature analysis and semistructured interviews with 40 industry experts to identify a comprehensive list of construction themes and factors affected by the pandemic; (2) survey data collection from 388 industry professionals to quantify the significance and influence of each identified factor; (3) Cronbach's alpha test to check the reliability of the survey; (4) fuzzy inference system to assess the impact of the pandemic on each construction theme and factor; and (5) Mann-Whitney U-test to examine the perceived impact by the public and private sectors. Results show that the pandemic has impacted a total of 16 construction factors grouped under four construction themes, including contractual implications, construction financial market, and supply chain operations, as well as safety and risk management, where the latter is the most impacted theme. The factors impacted the most by the pandemic are safety management measures, interpretation of the contract language, building materials prices, risk management practices, construction materials, construction labor, and construction subcontractors. Also, the findings of the fuzzy model show significant difference in the captured impact of the pandemic between the public and private sectors. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a foothold foundation for researchers and decision makers to enhance investigating the effect of the pandemic with its deep uncertainties in relation to developing countries. &lt;/p&gt;",2022-01-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce,1141,2,0.5738818557743143,"['Baba Hassane', 'Lamis Makki', 'Abdelkrim Bennabi', 'Rabah Hamzaoui', 'M.

FAST-LIO2: Fast Direct LiDAR-Inertial Odometry,"This article presents FAST-LIO2: a fast, robust, and versatile LiDAR-inertial odometry framework. Building on a highly efficient tightly coupled iterated Kalman filter, FAST-LIO2 has two key novelties that allow fast, robust, and accurate LiDAR navigation (and mapping). The first one is directly registering raw points to the map (and subsequently update the map, i.e., mapping) without extracting features. This enables the exploitation of subtle features in the environment and, hence, increases the accuracy. The elimination of a hand-engineered feature extraction module also makes it naturally adaptable to emerging LiDARs of different scanning patterns; the second main novelty is maintaining a map by an incremental k-dimensional (k-d) tree data structure, incremental k-d tree ( <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">ikd-Tree</i> ), that enables incremental updates (i.e., point insertion and delete) and dynamic rebalancing. Compared with existing dynamic data structures (octree, R <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^\ast$</tex-math></inline-formula> -tree, and <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">nanoflann</i> k-d tree), <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">ikd-Tree</i> achieves superior overall performance while naturally supports downsampling on the tree. We conduct an exhaustive benchmark comparison in 19 sequences from a variety of open LiDAR datasets. FAST-LIO2 achieves consistently higher accuracy at a much lower computation load than other state-of-the-art LiDAR-inertial navigation systems. Various real-world experiments on solid-state LiDARs with small field of view are also conducted. Overall, FAST-LIO2 is computationally efficient (e.g., up to 100 Hz odometry and mapping in large outdoor environments), robust (e.g., reliable pose estimation in cluttered indoor environments with rotation up to 1000 deg/s), versatile (i.e., applicable to both multiline spinning and solid-state LiDARs, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and handheld platforms, and Intel- and ARM-based processors), while still achieving a higher accuracy than existing methods.

A Step-by-Step Process of Thematic Analysis to Develop a Conceptual Model in Qualitative Research,"Thematic analysis is a highly popular technique among qualitative researchers for analyzing qualitative data, which usually comprises thick descriptive data. However, the application and use of thematic analysis has also involved complications due to confusion regarding the final outcome’s presentation as a conceptual model. This paper develops a systematic thematic analysis process for creating a conceptual model from qualitative research findings. It explores the adaptability of the proposed process across various research methodologies, including constructivist methodologies, positivist methodologies, grounded theory, and interpretive phenomenology, and justifies their application. The paper distinguishes between inductive and deductive coding approaches and emphasizes the merits of each. It suggests that the derived systematic thematic analysis model is valuable across multiple disciplines, particularly in grounded theory, ethnographic approaches, and narrative approaches, while also being adaptable to more descriptive, positivist-based methodologies. By providing a methodological roadmap, this study enhances the rigor and replicability of thematic analysis and offers a comprehensive strategy for theoretical conceptualization in qualitative research. The contribution of this paper is a systematic six-step thematic analysis process that leads to the development of a conceptual model; each step is described in detail and examples are given.",2023-10-01,2023,https://doi.org/10.1177/16094069231205789,1136,2,1.0,"['Muhammad Naeem', 'Wilson Ozuem', 'Kerry E.

The clinician’s guide to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease in the USA and the world. It is a subclinical condition until complicated by fracture(s). These fractures place an enormous medical and personal burden on individuals who suffer from them and take a significant economic toll. Any new fracture in an adult aged 50 years or older signifies imminent elevated risk for subsequent fractures, particularly in the year following the initial fracture. What a patient perceives as an unfortunate accident may be seen as a sentinel event indicative of bone fragility and increased future fracture risk even when the result of considerable trauma. Clinical or subclinical vertebral fractures, the most common type of osteoporotic fractures, are associated with a 5-fold increased risk for additional vertebral fractures and a 2- to 3-fold increased risk for fractures at other sites. Untreated osteoporosis can lead to a vicious cycle of recurrent fracture(s), often resulting in disability and premature death. In appropriate patients, treatment with effective antifracture medication prevents fractures and improves outcomes. Primary care providers and medical specialists are critical gatekeepers who can identify fractures and initiate proven osteoporosis interventions. Osteoporosis detection, diagnosis, and treatment should be routine practice in all adult healthcare settings. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation (BHOF) - formerly the National Osteoporosis Foundation - first published the Clinician's Guide in 1999 to provide accurate information on osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Since that time, significant improvements have been made in diagnostic technologies and treatments for osteoporosis. Despite these advances, a disturbing gap persists in patient care. At-risk patients are often not screened to establish fracture probability and not educated about fracture prevention. Most concerning, the majority of highest risk women and men who have a fracture(s) are not diagnosed and do not receive effective, FDA-approved therapies. Even those prescribed appropriate therapy are unlikely to take the medication as prescribed. The Clinician's Guide offers concise recommendations regarding prevention, risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years and older. It includes indications for bone densitometry as well as fracture risk thresholds for pharmacologic intervention. Current medications build bone and/or decrease bone breakdown and dramatically reduce incident fractures. All antifracture therapeutics treat but do not cure the disease. Skeletal deterioration resumes sooner or later when a medication is discontinued-sooner for nonbisphosphonates and later for bisphosphonates. Even if normal BMD is achieved, osteoporosis and elevated risk for fracture are still present. The diagnosis of osteoporosis persists even if subsequent DXA T-scores are above - 2.5. Ongoing monitoring and strategic interventions will be necessary if fractures are to be avoided. In addition to pharmacotherapy, adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol intake, weight-bearing and resistance-training exercise, and fall prevention are included in the fracture prevention armamentarium. Where possible, recommendations in this guide are based on evidence from RCTs; however, relevant published data and guidance from expert clinical experience provides the basis for recommendations in those areas where RCT evidence is currently deficient or not applicable to the many osteoporosis patients not considered for RCT participation due to age and morbidity.",2022-04-28,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-021-05900-y,1135,1,1.0,"['Meryl S.

Evidence of escape of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 from natural and vaccine-induced sera,"The race to produce vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began when the first sequence was published, and this forms the basis for vaccines currently deployed globally. Independent lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been reported: UK, B.1.1.7; South Africa, B.1.351; and Brazil, P.1. These variants have multiple changes in the immunodominant spike protein that facilitates viral cell entry via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. Mutations in the receptor recognition site on the spike are of great concern for their potential for immune escape. Here, we describe a structure-function analysis of B.1.351 using a large cohort of convalescent and vaccinee serum samples. The receptor-binding domain mutations provide tighter ACE2 binding and widespread escape from monoclonal antibody neutralization largely driven by E484K, although K417N and N501Y act together against some important antibody classes. In a number of cases, it would appear that convalescent and some vaccine serum offers limited protection against this variant.",2021-02-23,2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.037,1134,1,0.21475271592376613,"['Daming Zhou', 'Wanwisa Dejnirattisai', 'Piyada Supasa', 'Chang Liu', 'Alexander J.

Electroceramics for High-Energy Density Capacitors: Current Status and Future Perspectives,"Materials exhibiting high energy/power density are currently needed to meet the growing demand of portable electronics, electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage devices. The highest energy densities are achieved for fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors, but conventional dielectric capacitors are receiving increased attention for pulsed power applications due to their high power density and their fast charge-discharge speed. The key to high energy density in dielectric capacitors is a large maximum but small remanent (zero in the case of linear dielectrics) polarization and a high electric breakdown strength. Polymer dielectric capacitors offer high power/energy density for applications at room temperature, but above 100 °C they are unreliable and suffer from dielectric breakdown. For high-temperature applications, therefore, dielectric ceramics are the only feasible alternative. Lead-based ceramics such as La-doped lead zirconate titanate exhibit good energy storage properties, but their toxicity raises concern over their use in consumer applications, where capacitors are exclusively lead free. Lead-free compositions with superior power density are thus required. In this paper, we introduce the fundamental principles of energy storage in dielectrics. We discuss key factors to improve energy storage properties such as the control of local structure, phase assemblage, dielectric layer thickness, microstructure, conductivity, and electrical homogeneity through the choice of base systems, dopants, and alloying additions, followed by a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art. Finally, we comment on the future requirements for new materials in high power/energy density capacitor applications.",2021-04-28,2021,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c01264,1133,-1,0.29842396913373875,"['Ge Wang', 'Zhilun Lu', 'Yong Li', 'Linhao Li', 'Hongfen Ji', 'Antonio Feteira', 'Di Zhou', 'Dawei Wang', 'Shujun Zhang', 'Ian M.

Antagonism of Mycorrhizal Fungi to Root Pathogenic Fungi and Soil Bacteria,"Antagonism of ectotrophic mycorrhizal fungi to Phytophthora cinnamomi, other root pathogenic fungi, and soil bacteria was examined. In agar plate tests, Laccaria laccata, Lactarius deliciosus, Leucopaxillus cerealis var. piceina, Pisolithus tinctorius, and Suillus luteus inhibited growth of nearly half of the 48 different fungal root pathogens. Leucopaxillus cerealis var. piceina inhibited 92% of the test pathogens. Differences in sensitivity of several isolates of P. cinnamomi to inhibitions by this symbiont were not found. Culture filtrates of L. cerealis var. piceina were inhibitory also to growth of P. cinnamomi and soil bacteria. Zoospore germination was inhibited completely in filtrates of this symbiont. Maximum antibiotic production occurred during the rapid growth phase in liquid culture. Length of culture incubation and temperature strongly influenced production of inhibitory substances by L. cerealis var. piceina in liquid culture.

The microbiome and human cancer,"BACKGROUND Historical accounts linking cancer and microbes date as early as four millennia ago. After establishment of the germ theory of infectious diseases, clinical research of microbial influences on cancer began in 1868, when William Busch reported spontaneous tumor regressions in patients with Streptococcus pyogenes infections. Over the next century, poor reproducibility, erroneous microbiological claims, and severe toxicity led many to discount the role of bacteria in carcinogenesis and cancer therapy. However, these studies provided the first crude demonstrations of cancer immunotherapy. Contemporaneously, the viral theory of cancer flourished, spurred by the 1911 discovery of Rous sarcoma virus, which transformed benign tissue into malignant tumors in chickens. The decades-long search to find viruses behind every human cancer ultimately failed, and many cancers have been linked to somatic mutations. Now the field is encountering intriguing claims of the importance of microbes, including bacteria and fungi, in cancer and cancer therapy. This Review critically evaluates this evidence in light of modern cancer biology and immunology, delineating roles for microbes in cancer by examining advances in proposed mechanisms, diagnostics, and modulation strategies. ADVANCES Few microbes directly cause cancer, but many seem complicit in its growth, often acting through the host’s immune system; conversely, several have immunostimulatory properties. Mechanistic analyses of gut microbiota–immune system interactions reveal powerful effects on antitumor immunity by modulating primary and secondary lymphoid tissue activities. Many of these pathways invoke Toll-like receptor–initiated cytokine signaling, but microbial metabolic effects and antigenic mimicry with cancer cells are also important. In preclinical models, microbial metabolites also regulate phenotypes of tumor somatic mutations and modulate immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy. Emerging evidence suggests that intratumoral bacteria exist and are active, with overlapping immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and sequencing data in ~10 cancer types. Preliminary studies further suggest that fungi and bacteriophages contribute to gastrointestinal cancers. However, the abundance of intratumoral microbial cells is low relative to cancer cells, and knowledge of their functional repertoire and potency remains limited. Further validation of their prevalence and impact is needed in diverse cohorts and therapeutic contexts. The immunomodulatory effects of host microbiota have reinvigorated efforts to change their composition as a form of immunotherapy. Despite extensive preclinical evidence, translation of microbiota modulation approaches into humans has not yet materialized into commercialized therapies. Synthetic biology approaches are also gaining traction, with engineered bacterial cancer therapies in preclinical and clinical trial settings. OUTLOOK A better understanding of the roles of microbes in cancer provides an opportunity to improve each stage of the cancer care cycle, but major challenges remain. Concerted efforts to characterize cancer-associated microbiota among tumor, stool, and blood samples with gold-standard contamination controls would tremendously aid this progress. This would be analogous to The Cancer Genome Atlas’s role in characterizing the cancer somatic mutation landscape. Large-scale clinical trials are currently testing the efficacy of microbiota modulation approaches, ranging from dietary modifications to intratumorally injected, engineered bacteria. These bacterial cancer therapies, if safe and effective, could tremendously expand the cancer therapy armamentarium. Altogether, integrating the host-centric and microbial viewpoints of cancer may improve patient outcomes while providing a nuanced understanding of cancer-host-microbial evolution. Opportunities for microbes to affect cancer care. Diagnosis: Cancer-specific, blood-borne microbial DNA may complement cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA). Prognosis: Gut and intratumoral microbiota may stratify patient outcomes (NR, nonresponder; R, responder; TME, tumor microenvironment). Therapy: Intratumor injection of CD47 nanobody (CD47nb)–producing Escherichia coli may create systemic antitumor immunity by enhancing dendritic cell (DC) phagocytosis, lymph node (LN) antigen (Ag) presentation, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity.",2021-03-25,2021,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abc4552,1127,3,0.6464966491558679,"['Gregory D.

Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks: A Molecular Platform for Designing Functions beyond Chemical Recycling and Self-Healing,"Dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPN) have historically attracted attention for their unique roles in chemical recycling and self-healing, which are both relevant for sustainable societal development. Efforts in these directions have intensified in the past decade with notable progress in newly discovered dynamic covalent chemistry, fundamental material concepts, and extension toward emerging applications including energy and electronic devices. Beyond that, the values of DCPN in discovering/designing functional properties not offered by classical thermoplastic and thermoset polymers have recently gained traction. In particular, the dynamic bond exchangeability of DCPN has shown unparalleled design versatility in various areas including shape-shifting materials/devices, artificial muscles, and microfabrication. Going beyond this basic bond exchangeability, various molecular mechanisms to manipulate network topologies (topological transformation) have led to opportunities to program polymers, with notable concepts such as living networks and topological isomerization. In this review, we provide an overview of the above progress with particular focuses on molecular design strategies for the exploitation of functional material properties. Based on this, we point out the remaining issues and offer perspectives on how this class of materials can shape the future in ways that are complementary with classical thermoplastic and thermoset polymers.",2021-01-04,2021,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00938,1124,4,0.4763884039493206,"['Ning Zheng', 'Yang Xu', 'Qian Zhao', 'Tao Xie']",,False

Global prevalence of depression and elevated depressive symptoms among adolescents: A systematic review and meta‐analysis,"Objective Adolescence is a formative and turbulent phase where physiological, psychosocial, and cognitive changes leave adolescents vulnerable to psychological disorders. Given the lack of reviews that consolidate and compare worldwide prevalence of depression among adolescents, this review aims to examine the global prevalence of major depressive disorders, dysthymia, and elevated depressive symptoms among adolescents. Methods A systematic review and meta‐analysis was conducted. Six databases were searched for studies published from 2001 to December 2020. Seventy‐two studies were included. Subgroup analysis were performed for year of publication, geographical region, gender, and assessment tools used. Results The global point prevalence rate of elevated self‐reported depressive symptoms from 2001 to 2020 was 34% (95% CI: 0.30–0.38). Point prevalence for major depressive disorder (MDD) and dysthymia was 8% (95% CI: 0.02–0.13) and 4% (95% CI: 0.01–0.07), respectively. The pooled one‐year prevalence and lifetime prevalence for MDD were 8% (95% CI: 0.05–0.12) and 19% (95% CI: 0.12–0.26). Point prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms among adolescents increased from 24% (95% CI: 0.19–0.28) between 2001 and 2010 to 37% (95% CI: 0.32–0.42) between 2011 and 2020. The Middle East, Africa, and Asia have the highest prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms, and female adolescents were reported to have a higher prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms than male adolescents. Conclusion Besides targeting those with existing clinical depression, research and policies should also focus on educational and supportive mitigation efforts to curb depressive symptoms among adolescents before escalation. The findings encourage future research to develop more gender‐specific and culturally relevant intervention programmes. Practitioner points 34% of adolescents globally, aged 10‐19 years, are at risk of developing clinical depression, which exceeds the reported estimates of individuals aged 18 to 25 years. Practitioners are highly encouraged to prioritize depression screening and intervention implementation for individuals in this age group. Female adolescents and adolescents from Middle East, Africa, and Asia have the highest risk of developing depression. This urges practitioners and researchers to develop more gender‐specific and culturally relevant intervention programmes.",2021-09-26,2021,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjc.12333,1123,1,1.0,"['Shefaly Shorey', 'Esperanza Debby Ng', 'Celine Wong']",,False

Worst-Case Analysis of a New Heuristic for the Travelling Salesman Problem,Abstract An O( n 3 ) heuristic algorithm is described for solving d -city travelling salesman problems (TSP) whose cost matrix satisfies the triangularity condition. The algorithm involves as substeps the computation of a shortest spanning tree of the graph G defining the TSP and the finding of a minimum cost perfect matching of a certain induced subgraph of G . A worst-case analysis of this heuristic shows that the ratio of the answer obtained to the optimum TSP solution is strictly less than 3/2. This represents a 50% reduction over the value 2 which was the previously best known such ratio for the performance of other polynomial growth algorithms for the TSP.,2022-03-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43069-021-00101-z,1120,0,1.0,['Nicos Christofides'],,True
NF-κB in biology and targeted therapy: new insights and translational implications,"Abstract NF-κB signaling has been discovered for nearly 40 years. Initially, NF-κB signaling was identified as a pivotal pathway in mediating inflammatory responses. However, with extensive and in-depth investigations, researchers have discovered that its role can be expanded to a variety of signaling mechanisms, biological processes, human diseases, and treatment options. In this review, we first scrutinize the research process of NF-κB signaling, and summarize the composition, activation, and regulatory mechanism of NF-κB signaling. We investigate the interaction of NF-κB signaling with other important pathways, including PI3K/AKT, MAPK, JAK-STAT, TGF-β, Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, and TLR signaling. The physiological and pathological states of NF-κB signaling, as well as its intricate involvement in inflammation, immune regulation, and tumor microenvironment, are also explicated. Additionally, we illustrate how NF-κB signaling is involved in a variety of human diseases, including cancers, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and COVID-19. Further, we discuss the therapeutic approaches targeting NF-κB signaling, including IKK inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, proteasome inhibitors, nuclear translocation inhibitors, DNA binding inhibitors, TKIs, non-coding RNAs, immunotherapy, and CAR-T. Finally, we provide an outlook for research in the field of NF-κB signaling. We hope to present a stereoscopic, comprehensive NF-κB signaling that will inform future research and clinical practice.",2024-03-04,2024,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-024-01757-9,1119,3,0.41607320938443715,"['Qing Guo', 'Yizi Jin', 'Xinyu Chen', 'Xiaomin Ye', 'Xin Shen', 'Mingxi Lin', 'Cheng Zeng', 'Teng Zhou', 'Jian Zhang']",,True
CSWin Transformer: A General Vision Transformer Backbone with Cross-Shaped Windows,"We present CSWin Transformer, an efficient and effective Transformer-based backbone for general-purpose vision tasks. A challenging issue in Transformer design is that global self-attention is very expensive to compute whereas local self-attention often limits the field of interactions of each token. To address this issue, we develop the Cross-Shaped Window self-attention mechanism for computing self-attention in the horizontal and vertical stripes in parallel that form a cross-shaped window, with each stripe obtained by splitting the input feature into stripes of equal width. We provide a mathematical analysis of the effect of the stripe width and vary the stripe width for different layers of the Transformer network which achieves strong modeling capability while limiting the computation cost. We also introduce Locally-enhanced Positional Encoding (LePE), which handles the local positional information better than existing encoding schemes. LePE naturally supports arbitrary input resolutions, and is thus especially effective and friendly for downstream tasks. Incorporated with these designs and a hierarchical structure, CSWin Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on common vision tasks. Specifically, it achieves 85.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra training data or label, 53.9 box AP and 46.4 mask AP on the COCO detection task, and 52.2 mIOU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art Swin Transformer backbone by +1.2, +2.0, +1.4, and +2.0 respectively under the similar FLOPs setting. By further pretraining on the larger dataset ImageNet-21K, we achieve 87.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K and high segmentation performance on ADE20K with 55.7 mIoU. <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">1</sup> <sup xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">1</sup> Code and pretrain model is available at https://github.com/microsoft/CSWin-Transformer",2022-06-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr52688.2022.01181,1118,0,0.8627620128050477,"['Xiaoyi Dong', 'Jianmin Bao', 'Dongdong Chen', 'Weiming Zhang', 'Nenghai Yu', 'Lu Yuan', 'Dong Chen', 'Baining Guo']",,False
Handbook of Religion and Health,"Abstract The 2001 (first) edition of this Handbook was a comprehensive review of history, research, and discussions on religion and health through the year 2000. The Appendix listed 1,200 separate quantitative studies on religion and health each rated in quality on 0–10 scale, followed by about 2,000 references and an extensive index for rapid topic identification. The 2012 (second) edition of the Handbook systematically updated the research from 2000 to 2010, with the number of quantitative studies then reaching the thousands. This 2023 (third) edition is the most scientifically rigorous edition to date, covering the best research published through 2021 with an emphasis on prospective studies and randomized controlled trials. Beginning with a Foreword by Dr. Howard K. Koh, former US Assistant Secretary for Health for the Department of Health and Human Services, this nearly 600,000-word volume examines almost every aspect of health, reviewing past and more recent research on the relationship between religion and health outcomes. Furthermore, nearly all of its 34 chapters conclude with clinical and community applications, making this text relevant to both healthcare professionals (physicians, nurses, social workers, rehabilitation therapists, counselors, psychologists, sociologists, etc.) and clergy (community clergy, chaplains, pastoral counselors, etc.).

Management of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection: the Maastricht VI/Florence consensus report,"Helicobacter pylori Infection is formally recognised as an infectious disease, an entity that is now included in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision.

In the context of the wide clinical spectrum associated with Helicobacter pylori gastritis, specific issues persist and require regular updates for optimised management. The identification of distinct clinical scenarios, proper testing and adoption of effective strategies for prevention of gastric cancer and other complications are addressed. H. pylori treatment is challenged by the continuously rising antibiotic resistance and demands for susceptibility testing with consideration of novel molecular technologies and careful selection of first line and rescue therapies.

"Sangerbox: A comprehensive, interaction‐friendly clinical bioinformatics analysis platform","Abstract In recent decades, with the continuous development of high‐throughput sequencing technology, data volume in medical research has increased, at the same time, almost all clinical researchers have their own independent omics data, which provided a better condition for data mining and a deeper understanding of gene functions. However, for these large amounts of data, many common and cutting‐edge effective bioinformatics research methods still cannot be widely used. This has encouraged the establishment of many analytical platforms, a portion of databases or platforms were designed to solve the special analysis needs of users, for instance, MG RAST, IMG/M, Qiita, BIGSdb, and TRAPR were developed for specific omics research, and some databases or servers provide solutions for special problems solutions. Metascape was designed to only provide functional annotations of genes as well as function enrichment analysis; BioNumerics and RidomSeqSphere+ perform multilocus sequence typing; CARD provides only antimicrobial resistance annotations. Additionally, some web services are outdated, and inefficient interaction often fails to meet the needs of researchers, such as our previous versions of the platform. Therefore, the demand to complete massive data processing tasks urgently requires a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis platform. Hence, we have developed a website platform, Sangerbox 3.0 ( http://vip.sangerbox.com/ ), a web‐based tool platform. On a user‐friendly interface that also supports differential analysis, the platform provides interactive customizable analysis tools, including various kinds of correlation analyses, pathway enrichment analysis, weighted correlation network analysis, and other common tools and functions, users only need to upload their own corresponding data into Sangerbox 3.0, select required parameters, submit, and wait for the results after the task has been completed. We have also established a new interactive plotting system that allows users to adjust the parameters in the image; moreover, optimized plotting performance enables users to adjust large‐capacity vector maps on the web site. At the same time, we have integrated GEO, TCGA, ICGC, and other databases and processed data in batches, greatly reducing the difficulty to obtain data and improving the efficiency of bioimformatics study for users. Finally, we also provide users with rich sources of bioinformatics analysis courses, offering a platform for researchers to share and exchange knowledge.",2022-07-08,2022,https://doi.org/10.1002/imt2.36,1109,5,0.31866280899672783,"['Weitao Shen', 'Ziguang Song', 'Xiao Yan Zhong', 'Mei Huang', 'Danting Shen', 'Pingping Gao', 'Xiaoqian Qian', 'Mengmeng Wang', 'Xiubin He', 'Tonglian Wang', 'Shuang Li', 'Xiang Song']",,True
Model-Contrastive Federated Learning,"Federated learning enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a machine learning model without communicating their local data.

The Racial Contract,"The Racial Contract puts classic Western social contract theory, deadpan, to extraordinary radical use. With a sweeping look at the European expansionism and racism of the last five hundred years, Charles W. Mills demonstrates how this peculiar and unacknowledged ""contract"" has shaped a system of global European domination: how it brings into existence ""whites"" and ""non-whites,"" full persons and sub-persons, how it influences white moral theory and moral psychology; and how this system is imposed on non-whites through ideological conditioning and violence. The Racial Contract argues that the society we live in is a continuing white supremacist state. Holding up a mirror to mainstream philosophy, this provocative book explains the evolving outline of the racial contract from the time of the New World conquest and subsequent colonialism to the written slavery contract, to the ""separate but equal"" system of segregation in the twentieth-century United States. According to Mills, the contract has provided the theoretical architecture justifying an entire history of European atrocity against non-whites, from David Hume's and Immanuel Kant's claims that blacks had inferior cognitive power, to the Holocaust, to the kind of imperialism in Asia that was demonstrated by the Vietnam War. Mills suggests that the ghettoization of philosophical work on race is no accident. This work challenges the assumption that mainstream theory is itself raceless. Just as feminist theory has revealed orthodox political philosophy's invisible white male bias, Mills's explication of the racial contract exposes its racial underpinnings",2022-04-15,2022,https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501764301,1109,2,0.7988210850700193,['Charles W.

Ten Years of Progress in the Synthesis and Development of MXenes,"Abstract Since their discovery in 2011, the number of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) has steadily increased. Currently more than 40 MXene compositions exist. The ultimate number is far greater and in time they may develop into the largest family of 2D materials known. MXenes’ unique properties, such as their metal‐like electrical conductivity reaching ≈20 000 S cm −1 , render them quite useful in a large number of applications, including energy storage, optoelectronic, biomedical, communications, and environmental. The number of MXene papers and patents published has been growing quickly. The first MXene generation is synthesized using selective etching of metal layers from the MAX phases, layered transition metal carbides and carbonitrides using hydrofluoric acid. Since then, multiple synthesis approaches have been developed, including selective etching in a mixture of fluoride salts and various acids, non‐aqueous etchants, halogens, and molten salts, allowing for the synthesis of new MXenes with better control over their surface chemistries. Herein, a brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development are provided.

EfficientNetV2: Smaller Models and Faster Training,"This paper introduces EfficientNetV2, a new family of convolutional networks that have faster training speed and better parameter efficiency than previous models. To develop this family of models, we use a combination of training-aware neural architecture search and scaling, to jointly optimize training speed and parameter efficiency. The models were searched from the search space enriched with new ops such as Fused-MBConv. Our experiments show that EfficientNetV2 models train much faster than state-of-the-art models while being up to 6.8x smaller. Our training can be further sped up by progressively increasing the image size during training, but it often causes a drop in accuracy. To compensate for this accuracy drop, we propose to adaptively adjust regularization (e.g., dropout and data augmentation) as well, such that we can achieve both fast training and good accuracy. With progressive learning, our EfficientNetV2 significantly outperforms previous models on ImageNet and CIFAR/Cars/Flowers datasets. By pretraining on the same ImageNet21k, our EfficientNetV2 achieves 87.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet ILSVRC2012, outperforming the recent ViT by 2.0% accuracy while training 5x-11x faster using the same computing resources.

CO <sub>2</sub> electrolysis to multicarbon products in strong acid,"Potassium helps CO 2 compete in acid Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is a promising means of converting this greenhouse gas into valuable fuels and chemicals. However, two competing reactions restrict the efficiency of this process. In base, much of the CO 2 is trapped as carbonate before reduction; in acid, protons outpace CO 2 at catching electrons from the cathode. Huang et al. report that a high dose of potassium ions can help to solve the latter problem. By concentrating potassium ions at the electrode, high selectivity toward CO 2 reduction at high current in acid is possible, which the authors attribute to electrostatic stabilization of the desired adsorbates.

A Survey of Machine and Deep Learning Methods for Internet of Things (IoT) Security,"The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates billions of smart devices that can communicate with one another with minimal human intervention. IoT is one of the fastest developing fields in the history of computing, with an estimated 50 billion devices by the end of 2020. However, the crosscutting nature of IoT systems and the multidisciplinary components involved in the deployment of such systems have introduced new security challenges. Implementing security measures, such as encryption, authentication, access control, network and application security for IoT devices and their inherent vulnerabilities is ineffective. Therefore, existing security methods should be enhanced to effectively secure the IoT ecosystem. Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) have advanced considerably over the last few years, and machine intelligence has transitioned from laboratory novelty to practical machinery in several important applications. Consequently, ML/DL methods are important in transforming the security of IoT systems from merely facilitating secure communication between devices to security-based intelligence systems. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive survey of ML methods and recent advances in DL methods that can be used to develop enhanced security methods for IoT systems. IoT security threats that are related to inherent or newly introduced threats are presented, and various potential IoT system attack surfaces and the possible threats related to each surface are discussed. We then thoroughly review ML/DL methods for IoT security and present the opportunities, advantages and shortcomings of each method. We discuss the opportunities and challenges involved in applying ML/DL to IoT security. These opportunities and challenges can serve as potential future research directions. 1998-2012 IEEE.",2022-04-21,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/comst.2020.2988293,1099,0,0.6974571727932903,"['Mohammed Ali Al-Garadi', 'Amr Mohamed', 'Abdulla Al‐Ali', 'Xiaojiang Du', 'Ihsan Ali', 'Mohsen Guizani']",,False

Major advances in this chapter since the SROCC include the synthesis of extended and new observations, which allows for improved assessment of past change, processes and budgets for the last century, and the use of a hierarchy of models and emulators, which provide improved projections and uncertainty estimates of future change. In addition, the systematic use of model emulators makes our projections of ocean heat content, land-ice loss and sea level rise fully consistent both with each other and with the assessed equilibrium climate sensitivity and projections of global surface air temperature across the entire report.

2023 ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes,"Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence, with the aim of assisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or therapeutic approach for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines are intended for use by health professionals and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) makes its Guidelines freely available. ESC Guidelines do not override the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription, and, where appropriate, to respect the ethical rules of their profession. ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated. ESC Policies and Procedures for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines). The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients with this pathology. The selection procedure aimed to include members from across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty Communities. Consideration was given to diversity and inclusion, notably with respect to gender and country of origin. The Task Force performed a critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, including assessment of the risk-benefit ratio. The strength of every recommendation and the level of evidence supporting them were weighed and scored according to pre-defined scales as outlined below. The Task Force followed ESC voting procedures, and all approved recommendations were subject to a vote and achieved at least 75% agreement among voting members. The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines), and have been compiled in a report published in a supplementary document with the guidelines. The Task Force received its entire financial support from the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry. The ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) Committee supervises and co-ordinates the preparation of new guidelines and is responsible for the approval process. ESC Guidelines undergo extensive review by the CPG Committee and external experts, including members from across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty Communities and National Cardiac Societies. After appropriate revisions, the guidelines are signed off by all the experts involved in the Task Force. The finalized document is signed off by the CPG Committee for publication in the European Heart Journal. The guidelines were developed after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their writing. Tables of evidence summarizing the findings of studies informing development of the guidelines are included. The ESC warns readers that the technical language may be misinterpreted and declines any responsibility in this respect. Off-label use of medication may be presented in the current Guidelines if a sufficient level of evidence shows that it can be considered medically appropriate for a given condition. However, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional giving special consideration to: The specific situation of the patient. Unless otherwise provided for by national regulations, off-label use of medication should be limited to situations where it is in the patient’s interest with regard to the quality, safety, and efficacy of care, and only after the patient has been informed and has provided consent.

Five-Year Survival Outcomes From the PACIFIC Trial: Durvalumab After Chemoradiotherapy in Stage III Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer,"PURPOSE The phase III PACIFIC trial compared durvalumab with placebo in patients with unresectable, stage III non–small-cell lung cancer and no disease progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Consolidation durvalumab was associated with significant improvements in the primary end points of overall survival (OS; stratified hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.87; P = .00251) and progression-free survival (PFS [blinded independent central review; RECIST v1.1]; stratified HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.65; P &lt; .0001), with manageable safety. We report updated, exploratory analyses of survival, approximately 5 years after the last patient was randomly assigned. METHODS Patients with WHO performance status 0 or 1 (any tumor programmed cell death-ligand 1 status) were randomly assigned (2:1) to durvalumab (10 mg/kg intravenously; administered once every 2 weeks for 12 months) or placebo, stratified by age, sex, and smoking history. Time-to-event end point analyses were performed using stratified log-rank tests. Medians and landmark survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Seven hundred and nine of 713 randomly assigned patients received durvalumab (473 of 476) or placebo (236 of 237). As of January 11, 2021 (median follow-up, 34.2 months [all patients]; 61.6 months [censored patients]), updated OS (stratified HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.89; median, 47.5 v 29.1 months) and PFS (stratified HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.68; median, 16.9 v 5.6 months) remained consistent with the primary analyses. Estimated 5-year rates (95% CI) for durvalumab and placebo were 42.9% (38.2 to 47.4) versus 33.4% (27.3 to 39.6) for OS and 33.1% (28.0 to 38.2) versus 19.0% (13.6 to 25.2) for PFS. CONCLUSION These updated analyses demonstrate robust and sustained OS and durable PFS benefit with durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy. An estimated 42.9% of patients randomly assigned to durvalumab remain alive at 5 years and 33.1% of patients randomly assigned to durvalumab remain alive and free of disease progression, establishing a new benchmark for standard of care in this setting.",2022-02-02,2022,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.21.01308,1089,3,0.38585093590822395,"['David R.

Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy,"The discovery of immune checkpoint proteins such as PD-1/PDL-1 and CTLA-4 represents a significant breakthrough in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, humanized monoclonal antibodies, targeting these immune checkpoint proteins have been utilized successfully in patients with metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancers and non-small lung cancer. The US FDA has successfully approved three different categories of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as PD-1 inhibitors (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Cemiplimab), PDL-1 inhibitors (Atezolimumab, Durvalumab and Avelumab), and CTLA-4 inhibitor (Ipilimumab). Unfortunately, not all patients respond favourably to these drugs, highlighting the role of biomarkers such as Tumour mutation burden (TMB), PDL-1 expression, microbiome, hypoxia, interferon-γ, and ECM in predicting responses to ICIs-based immunotherapy.

European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke,"Intravenous thrombolysis is the only approved systemic reperfusion treatment for patients with acute ischaemic stroke. These European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations to assist physicians in their clinical decisions with regard to intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke. These guidelines were developed based on the ESO standard operating procedure and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The working group identified relevant clinical questions, performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literature, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and wrote recommendations. Expert consensus statements were provided if not enough evidence was available to provide recommendations based on the GRADE approach. We found high quality evidence to recommend intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase to improve functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 h after symptom onset. We also found high quality evidence to recommend intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase in patients with acute ischaemic stroke on awakening from sleep, who were last seen well more than 4.5 h earlier, who have MRI DWI-FLAIR mismatch, and for whom mechanical thrombectomy is not planned. These guidelines provide further recommendations regarding patient subgroups, late time windows, imaging selection strategies, relative and absolute contraindications to alteplase, and tenecteplase. Intravenous thrombolysis remains a cornerstone of acute stroke management. Appropriate patient selection and timely treatment are crucial. Further randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to inform clinical decision-making with regard to tenecteplase and the use of intravenous thrombolysis before mechanical thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion.",2021-02-19,2021,https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987321989865,1087,-1,0.280670199227718,"['Eivind Berge', 'William Whiteley', 'Heinrich J.

Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners,"Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are widely used in many sub-fields of natural language processing (NLP) and generally known as excellent few-shot learners with task-specific exemplars. Notably, chain of thought (CoT) prompting, a recent technique for eliciting complex multi-step reasoning through step-by-step answer examples, achieved the state-of-the-art performances in arithmetics and symbolic reasoning, difficult system-2 tasks that do not follow the standard scaling laws for LLMs. While these successes are often attributed to LLMs' ability for few-shot learning, we show that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners by simply adding ""Let's think step by step"" before each answer. Experimental results demonstrate that our Zero-shot-CoT, using the same single prompt template, significantly outperforms zero-shot LLM performances on diverse benchmark reasoning tasks including arithmetics (MultiArith, GSM8K, AQUA-RAT, SVAMP), symbolic reasoning (Last Letter, Coin Flip), and other logical reasoning tasks (Date Understanding, Tracking Shuffled Objects), without any hand-crafted few-shot examples, e.g. increasing the accuracy on MultiArith from 17.7% to 78.7% and GSM8K from 10.4% to 40.7% with large InstructGPT model (text-davinci-002), as well as similar magnitudes of improvements with another off-the-shelf large model, 540B parameter PaLM. The versatility of this single prompt across very diverse reasoning tasks hints at untapped and understudied fundamental zero-shot capabilities of LLMs, suggesting high-level, multi-task broad cognitive capabilities may be extracted by simple prompting. We hope our work not only serves as the minimal strongest zero-shot baseline for the challenging reasoning benchmarks, but also highlights the importance of carefully exploring and analyzing the enormous zero-shot knowledge hidden inside LLMs before crafting finetuning datasets or few-shot exemplars.",2022-05-24,2022,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2205.11916,1084,0,0.37405511776481404,"['Takeshi Kojima', 'Shixiang Gu', 'Machel Reid', 'Yutaka Matsuo', 'Yusuke Iwasawa']",,True

Cardiac Energy Metabolism in Heart Failure,"Alterations in cardiac energy metabolism contribute to the severity of heart failure. However, the energy metabolic changes that occur in heart failure are complex and are dependent not only on the severity and type of heart failure present but also on the co-existence of common comorbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. The failing heart faces an energy deficit, primarily because of a decrease in mitochondrial oxidative capacity. This is partly compensated for by an increase in ATP production from glycolysis. The relative contribution of the different fuels for mitochondrial ATP production also changes, including a decrease in glucose and amino acid oxidation, and an increase in ketone oxidation. The oxidation of fatty acids by the heart increases or decreases, depending on the type of heart failure. For instance, in heart failure associated with diabetes and obesity, myocardial fatty acid oxidation increases, while in heart failure associated with hypertension or ischemia, myocardial fatty acid oxidation decreases. Combined, these energy metabolic changes result in the failing heart becoming less efficient (ie, a decrease in cardiac work/O 2 consumed). The alterations in both glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in the failing heart are due to both transcriptional changes in key enzymes involved in these metabolic pathways, as well as alterations in NAD redox state (NAD + and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels) and metabolite signaling that contribute to posttranslational epigenetic changes in the control of expression of genes encoding energy metabolic enzymes. Alterations in the fate of glucose, beyond flux through glycolysis or glucose oxidation, also contribute to the pathology of heart failure. Of importance, pharmacological targeting of the energy metabolic pathways has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach to improving cardiac efficiency, decreasing the energy deficit and improving cardiac function in the failing heart.",2021-05-13,2021,https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.121.318241,1081,1,0.46817549712850065,"['Gary D.

Global Carbon Budget 2023,"Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based fCO2 products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. Additional lines of evidence on land and ocean sinks are provided by atmospheric inversions, atmospheric oxygen measurements, and Earth system models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and incomplete understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the year 2022, EFOS increased by 0.9 % relative to 2021, with fossil emissions at 9.9±0.5 Gt C yr−1 (10.2±0.5 Gt C yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is not included), and ELUC was 1.2±0.7 Gt C yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission (including the cement carbonation sink) of 11.1±0.8 Gt C yr−1 (40.7±3.2 Gt CO2 yr−1). Also, for 2022, GATM was 4.6±0.2 Gt C yr−1 (2.18±0.1 ppm yr−1; ppm denotes parts per million), SOCEAN was 2.8±0.4 Gt C yr−1, and SLAND was 3.8±0.8 Gt C yr−1, with a BIM of −0.1 Gt C yr−1 (i.e. total estimated sources marginally too low or sinks marginally too high). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2022 reached 417.1±0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2023 suggest an increase in EFOS relative to 2022 of +1.1 % (0.0 % to 2.1 %) globally and atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 419.3 ppm, 51 % above the pre-industrial level (around 278 ppm in 1750). Overall, the mean of and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2022, with a near-zero overall budget imbalance, although discrepancies of up to around 1 Gt C yr−1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows the following: (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use changes emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living-data update documents changes in methods and data sets applied to this most recent global carbon budget as well as evolving community understanding of the global carbon cycle.

"Cosmology intertwined: A review of the particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology associated with the cosmological tensions and anomalies","The standard Λ Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological data. However, there are a few big open questions that make the standard model look like an approximation to a more realistic scenario yet to be found. In this paper, we list a few important goals that need to be addressed in the next decade, taking into account the current discordances between the different cosmological probes, such as the disagreement in the value of the Hubble constant H0, the σ8–S8 tension, and other less statistically significant anomalies. While these discordances can still be in part the result of systematic errors, their persistence after several years of accurate analysis strongly hints at cracks in the standard cosmological scenario and the necessity for new physics or generalisations beyond the standard model. In this paper, we focus on the 5.0σ tension between the Planck CMB estimate of the Hubble constant H0 and the SH0ES collaboration measurements. After showing the H0 evaluations made from different teams using different methods and geometric calibrations, we list a few interesting new physics models that could alleviate this tension and discuss how the next decade's experiments will be crucial. Moreover, we focus on the tension of the Planck CMB data with weak lensing measurements and redshift surveys, about the value of the matter energy density Ωm, and the amplitude or rate of the growth of structure (σ8,fσ8). We list a few interesting models proposed for alleviating this tension, and we discuss the importance of trying to fit a full array of data with a single model and not just one parameter at a time. Additionally, we present a wide range of other less discussed anomalies at a statistical significance level lower than the H0–S8 tensions which may also constitute hints towards new physics, and we discuss possible generic theoretical approaches that can collectively explain the non-standard nature of these signals. Finally, we give an overview of upgraded experiments and next-generation space missions and facilities on Earth that will be of crucial importance to address all these open questions.",2022-01-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jheap.2022.04.002,1079,6,1.0,"['Élcio Abdalla', 'Guillermo Franco Abellán', 'Amin Aboubrahim', 'Adriano Agnello', 'Özgür Akarsu', 'Y.

"Obesity: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Therapeutics","Obesity is a complex multifactorial disease that accumulated excess body fat leads to negative effects on health. Obesity continues to accelerate resulting in an unprecedented epidemic that shows no significant signs of slowing down any time soon. Raised body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and musculoskeletal disorders, resulting in dramatic decrease of life quality and expectancy. The main cause of obesity is long-term energy imbalance between consumed calories and expended calories. Here, we explore the biological mechanisms of obesity with the aim of providing actionable treatment strategies to achieve a healthy body weight from nature to nurture. This review summarizes the global trends in obesity with a special focus on the pathogenesis of obesity from genetic factors to epigenetic factors, from social environmental factors to microenvironment factors.

In general, the chapters apply what is known about human psychology to the study of politics. Chapters draw on theory and research on biopsychology, neuroscience, personality, psychopathology, evolutionary psychology, social psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, and intergroup relations. Some chapters address the political psychology of political elites—their personality, motives, beliefs, and leadership styles, and their judgments, decisions, and actions in domestic policy, foreign policy, international conflict, and conflict resolution. Other chapters deal with the dynamics of mass political behavior: voting, collective action, the influence of political communications, political socialization and civic education, group-based political behavior, social justice, and the political incorporation of immigrants.

Direct Photocatalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) for Aliphatic C–H Bonds Elaboration,"Direct photocatalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (<em>d</em>-HAT) can be considered a method of choice for the elaboration of aliphatic C–H bonds. In this manifold, a photocatalyst (PCHAT) exploits the energy of a photon to trigger the homolytic cleavage of such bonds in organic compounds. Selective C–H bond elaboration may be achieved by a judicious choice of the hydrogen abstractor (key parameters are the electronic character and the molecular structure), as well as reaction additives. Different are the classes of PCsHAT available, including aromatic ketones, xanthene dyes (Eosin Y), polyoxometalates, uranyl salts, a metal-oxo porphyrin and a tris(amino)cyclopropenium radical dication. The processes (mainly C–C bond formation) are in most cases carried out under mild conditions with the help of visible light.

Towards Total Recall in Industrial Anomaly Detection,"Being able to spot defective parts is a critical component in large-scale industrial manufacturing. A particular challenge that we address in this work is the cold-start problem: fit a model using nominal (non-defective) example images only. While handcrafted solutions per class are possible, the goal is to build systems that work well simultaneously on many different tasks automatically. The best peforming approaches combine embeddings from ImageNet models with an outlier detection model. In this paper, we extend on this line of work and propose PatchCore, which uses a maximally representative memory bank of nominal patch-features. PatchCore offers competitive inference times while achieving state-of-the-art performance for both detection and localization. On the challenging, widely used MVTec AD benchmark PatchCore achieves an image-level anomaly detection AUROC score of up to 99.6%, more than halving the error compared to the next best competitor. We further report competitive results on two additional datasets and also find competitive results in the few samples regime.

The technique is then explained in more detail, providing a deeper understanding of underlying principles. Finally the limitations of each technique are demonstrated by inserting faults, giving learners concrete examples of when each technique succeeds or fails in finding faults. Coverage includes black-box testing, white-box testing, random testing, unit testing, object-oriented testing, and application testing.

The false hope of current approaches to explainable artificial intelligence in health care,"The black-box nature of current artificial intelligence (AI) has caused some to question whether AI must be explainable to be used in high-stakes scenarios such as medicine. It has been argued that explainable AI will engender trust with the health-care workforce, provide transparency into the AI decision making process, and potentially mitigate various kinds of bias. In this Viewpoint, we argue that this argument represents a false hope for explainable AI and that current explainability methods are unlikely to achieve these goals for patient-level decision support. We provide an overview of current explainability techniques and highlight how various failure cases can cause problems for decision making for individual patients. In the absence of suitable explainability methods, we advocate for rigorous internal and external validation of AI models as a more direct means of achieving the goals often associated with explainability, and we caution against having explainability be a requirement for clinically deployed models.",2021-10-25,2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/s2589-7500(21)00208-9,1072,0,1.0,"['Marzyeh Ghassemi', 'Luke Oakden‐Rayner', 'Andrew L.

A Global Assessment: Can Renewable Energy Replace Fossil Fuels by 2050?,"Our study evaluated the effectiveness of using eight pathways in combination for a complete to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy by 2050. These pathways included renewable energy development; improving energy efficiency; increasing energy conservation; carbon taxes; more equitable balancing of human wellbeing and per capita energy use; cap and trade systems; carbon capture, utilization, and storage; and nuclear power development. We used the annual ‘British Petroleum statistical review of world energy 2021’ report as our primary database. Globally, fossil fuels, renewable (primarily hydro, wind and solar), nuclear energy accounted for 83%, 12.6%, and 6.3% of the total energy consumption in 2020. To achieve zero fossil fuel use by 2050, we found that renewable energy production will need to be increased by up to 6-fold or 8-fold if energy demand is held constant at, or increased 50% from, the 2020 energy demand level. Constraining 2050 world energy demand to a 25% increase over the 2020 level, improves the probability of achieving independence from fossil fuels. Improvements in energy efficiency need to accelerate beyond the current rate of ~1.5% per year. Aggressive application of energy conservation policies involving land use and taxation could potentially reduce world energy use by 10% or more by 2050. Our meta-analysis shows that the minimum level of per capita energy consumption that would allow 8 billion people to have a ‘Decent Living Standard’ is on average ~70 GJ per capita per year, which is 93% of the 2020 global average. Developed countries in temperate climates with high vehicle-dependency needed ~120 GJ per capita year−1, whereas equatorial countries with low vehicle-dependency needed 30 GJ per capita year−1. Our meta-analyses indicated replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy by 2050 may be possible but will require aggressive application of all eight pathways, major lifestyle changes in developed countries, and close cooperation among all countries.",2022-04-16,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/su14084792,1071,2,1.0,"['Jerry L.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Cardiovascular Disease: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent complete and partial upper airway obstructive events, resulting in intermittent hypoxemia, autonomic fluctuation, and sleep fragmentation. Approximately 34% and 17% of middle-aged men and women, respectively, meet the diagnostic criteria for OSA. Sleep disturbances are common and underdiagnosed among middle-aged and older adults, and the prevalence varies by race/ethnicity, sex, and obesity status. OSA prevalence is as high as 40% to 80% in patients with hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Despite its high prevalence in patients with heart disease and the vulnerability of cardiac patients to OSA-related stressors and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, OSA is often underrecognized and undertreated in cardiovascular practice. We recommend screening for OSA in patients with resistant/poorly controlled hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and recurrent atrial fibrillation after either cardioversion or ablation. In patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure and suspicion of sleep-disordered breathing or excessive daytime sleepiness, a formal sleep assessment is reasonable. In patients with tachy-brady syndrome or ventricular tachycardia or survivors of sudden cardiac death in whom sleep apnea is suspected after a comprehensive sleep assessment, evaluation for sleep apnea should be considered. After stroke, clinical equipoise exists with respect to screening and treatment. Patients with nocturnally occurring angina, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or appropriate shocks from implanted cardioverter-defibrillators may be especially likely to have comorbid sleep apnea. All patients with OSA should be considered for treatment, including behavioral modifications and weight loss as indicated. Continuous positive airway pressure should be offered to patients with severe OSA, whereas oral appliances can be considered for those with mild to moderate OSA or for continuous positive airway pressure–intolerant patients. Follow-up sleep testing should be performed to assess the effectiveness of treatment.",2021-06-21,2021,https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000988,1071,1,0.515726353499312,"['Yerem Yeghiazarians', 'Hani Jneid', 'Jeremy Tietjens', 'Susan Redline', 'Devin L.

Non-adherence to COVID-19 containment behaviours: results from an all-Ireland telephone survey,"Abstract Background COVID-19 public health measures like handwashing and social distancing can help stem the spread of the virus. Adherence to guidelines varies between individuals. This study aims to identify predictors of non-adherence to social distancing and handwashing guidelines. Methods A cross-sectional weekly telephone survey was conducted over eight weeks (11/06/2020–05/08/2020). The sample included adults resident on the island of Ireland (75:25 split between ROI and NI). Data were collected on demographics, threat perceptions, fear of COVID-19, response efficacy and self-efficacy, response cost and social norms, COVID-19 behaviours, mood, loneliness, and self-reported health. Results 3011 participants were surveyed. Handwashing non-adherers were more likely to be male (OR: 5.2, 95% CI: 2.4 – 11.3), to have higher levels of loneliness (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.1 – 3.1), and higher perceptions of handwashing costs (OR: 3.4, 95% CI: 2.2 – 5.2). Those reporting rarely engaging in social distancing were more likely to be members of lower socioeconomic groups, to be younger (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.96 – 0.98), male (OR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.1 – 2.5), healthcare workers (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.1 – 3.4), to report lower mood (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.3 – 2.2), were less likely to live in households with people aged under-18 (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.6 – 0.9), and to have lower fear of COVID-19 (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.6 – 0.9).

Globally, infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are on the rise. Antibiotics are being used to combat diversified bacterial infections. Synthetic biology techniques, in combination with molecular, functional genomic, and metagenomic studies of bacteria, plants, and even marine invertebrates are aimed at unlocking the world's natural products faster than previous methods of antibiotic discovery. There are currently only few viable remedies, potential preventive techniques, and a limited number of antibiotics, thereby necessitating the discovery of innovative medicinal approaches and antimicrobial therapies. MDR is also facilitated by biofilms, which makes infection control more complex. In this review, we have spotlighted comprehensively various aspects of antibiotics viz. overview of antibiotics era, mode of actions of antibiotics, development and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, and future strategies to fight the emerging antimicrobial resistant threat.",2021-10-25,2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.10.020,1070,1,0.8218669823641453,"['Tanvir Mahtab Uddin', 'Arka Chakraborty', 'Ameer Khusro', 'BM Redwan Matin Zidan', 'Saikat Mitra', 'Talha Bin Emran', 'Kuldeep Dhama', 'Md.

Cell cycle regulation: p53-p21-RB signaling,"Abstract The retinoblastoma protein RB and the transcription factor p53 are central tumor suppressors. They are often found inactivated in various tumor types. Both proteins play central roles in regulating the cell division cycle. RB forms complexes with the E2F family of transcription factors and downregulates numerous genes. Among the RB-E2F target genes, a large number code for key cell cycle regulators. Their transcriptional repression by the RB-E2F complex is released through phosphorylation of RB, leading to expression of the cell cycle regulators. The release from repression can be prevented by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/CDKN1A. The CDKN1A gene is transcriptionally activated by p53. Taken together, these elements constitute the p53-p21-RB signaling pathway. Following activation of p53, for example by viral infection or induction of DNA damage, p21 expression is upregulated. High levels of p21 then result in RB-E2F complex formation and downregulation of a large number of cell cycle genes. Thus, p53-dependent transcriptional repression is indirect. The reduced expression of the many regulators leads to cell cycle arrest. Examination of the p53-p21-RB targets and genes controlled by the related p53-p21-DREAM signaling pathway reveals that there is a large overlap of the two groups. Mechanistically this can be explained by replacing RB-E2F complexes with the DREAM transcriptional repressor complex at E2F sites in target promoters. In contrast to RB-E2F, DREAM can downregulate genes also through CHR transcription factor binding sites. This results in a distinct gene set controlled by p53-p21-DREAM signaling independent of RB-E2F. Furthermore, RB has non-canonical functions without binding to E2F and DNA. Such a role of RB supporting DREAM formation may be exerted by the RB-SKP2-p27-cyclin A/E-CDK2-p130-DREAM link. In the current synopsis, the mechanism of regulation by p53-p21-RB signaling is assessed and the overlap with p53-p21-DREAM signaling is examined.",2022-03-31,2022,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-022-00988-z,1069,3,0.4144186034345321,['Kurt Engeland'],,True

BUSCO: Assessing Genomic Data Quality and Beyond,"Abstract Evaluation of the quality of genomic “data products” such as genome assemblies or gene sets is of critical importance in order to recognize possible issues and correct them during the generation of new data. It is equally essential to guide subsequent or comparative analyses with existing data, as the correct interpretation of the results necessarily requires knowledge about the quality level and reliability of the inputs. Using datasets of near universal single‐copy orthologs derived from OrthoDB, BUSCO can estimate the completeness and redundancy of genomic data by providing biologically meaningful metrics based on expected gene content. These can complement technical metrics such as contiguity measures (e.g., number of contigs/scaffolds, and N50 values). Here, we describe the use of the BUSCO tool suite to assess different data types that can range from genome assemblies of single isolates and assembled transcriptomes and annotated gene sets to metagenome‐assembled genomes where the taxonomic origin of the species is unknown. BUSCO is the only tool capable of assessing all these types of sequences from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. The protocols detail the various BUSCO running modes and the novel workflows introduced in versions 4 and 5, including the batch analysis on multiple inputs, the auto‐lineage workflow to run assessments without specifying a dataset, and a workflow for the evaluation of (large) eukaryotic genomes. The protocols further cover the BUSCO setup, guidelines to interpret the results, and BUSCO “plugin” workflows for performing common operations in genomics using BUSCO results, such as building phylogenomic trees and visualizing syntenies. © 2021 The Authors.

Deep Learning Enabled Semantic Communication Systems,"Recently, deep learned enabled end-to-end communication systems have been developed to merge all physical layer blocks in the traditional communication systems, which make joint transceiver optimization possible. Powered by deep learning, natural language processing has achieved great success in analyzing and understanding a large amount of language texts. Inspired by research results in both areas, we aim to provide a new view on communication systems from the semantic level. Particularly, we propose a deep learning based semantic communication system, named DeepSC, for text transmission. Based on the Transformer, the DeepSC aims at maximizing the system capacity and minimizing the semantic errors by recovering the meaning of sentences, rather than bit- or symbol-errors in traditional communications. Moreover, transfer learning is used to ensure the DeepSC applicable to different communication environments and to accelerate the model training process. To justify the performance of semantic communications accurately, we also initialize a new metric, named sentence similarity. Compared with the traditional communication system without considering semantic information exchange, the proposed DeepSC is more robust to channel variation and is able to achieve better performance, especially in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) regime, as demonstrated by the extensive simulation results.",2021-01-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1109/tsp.2021.3071210,1062,0,0.40915032022854475,"['Huiqiang Xie', 'Zhijin Qin', 'Geoffrey Ye Li', 'Biing‐Hwang Juang']",,True

Accurate medium-range global weather forecasting with 3D neural networks,"Abstract Weather forecasting is important for science and society. At present, the most accurate forecast system is the numerical weather prediction (NWP) method, which represents atmospheric states as discretized grids and numerically solves partial differential equations that describe the transition between those states 1 . However, this procedure is computationally expensive. Recently, artificial-intelligence-based methods 2 have shown potential in accelerating weather forecasting by orders of magnitude, but the forecast accuracy is still significantly lower than that of NWP methods. Here we introduce an artificial-intelligence-based method for accurate, medium-range global weather forecasting. We show that three-dimensional deep networks equipped with Earth-specific priors are effective at dealing with complex patterns in weather data, and that a hierarchical temporal aggregation strategy reduces accumulation errors in medium-range forecasting. Trained on 39 years of global data, our program, Pangu-Weather, obtains stronger deterministic forecast results on reanalysis data in all tested variables when compared with the world’s best NWP system, the operational integrated forecasting system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 3 . Our method also works well with extreme weather forecasts and ensemble forecasts. When initialized with reanalysis data, the accuracy of tracking tropical cyclones is also higher than that of ECMWF-HRES.",2023-07-05,2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06185-3,1059,-1,0.33297617633617405,"['Kaifeng Bi', 'Lingxi Xie', 'Hengheng Zhang', 'Xin Chen', 'Xiaotao Gu', 'Qi Tian']",,True

Comparing network structures on three aspects: A permutation test.,"Network approaches to psychometric constructs, in which constructs are modeled in terms of interactions between their constituent factors, have rapidly gained popularity in psychology. Applications of such network approaches to various psychological constructs have recently moved from a descriptive stance, in which the goal is to estimate the network structure that pertains to a construct, to a more comparative stance, in which the goal is to compare network structures across populations. However, the statistical tools to do so are lacking. In this article, we present the network comparison test (NCT), which uses resampling-based permutation testing to compare network structures from two independent, cross-sectional data sets on invariance of (a) network structure, (b) edge (connection) strength, and (c) global strength. Performance of NCT is evaluated in simulations that show NCT to perform well in various circumstances for all three tests: The Type I error rate is close to the nominal significance level, and power proves sufficiently high if sample size and difference between networks are substantial. We illustrate NCT by comparing depression symptom networks of males and females. Possible extensions of NCT are discussed.

Lactate metabolism in human health and disease,"Abstract The current understanding of lactate extends from its origins as a byproduct of glycolysis to its role in tumor metabolism, as identified by studies on the Warburg effect. The lactate shuttle hypothesis suggests that lactate plays an important role as a bridging signaling molecule that coordinates signaling among different cells, organs and tissues. Lactylation is a posttranslational modification initially reported by Professor Yingming Zhao’s research group in 2019. Subsequent studies confirmed that lactylation is a vital component of lactate function and is involved in tumor proliferation, neural excitation, inflammation and other biological processes. An indispensable substance for various physiological cellular functions, lactate plays a regulatory role in different aspects of energy metabolism and signal transduction. Therefore, a comprehensive review and summary of lactate is presented to clarify the role of lactate in disease and to provide a reference and direction for future research. This review offers a systematic overview of lactate homeostasis and its roles in physiological and pathological processes, as well as a comprehensive overview of the effects of lactylation in various diseases, particularly inflammation and cancer.",2022-09-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-022-01151-3,1053,3,0.424156232804354,"['Xiaolu Li', 'Yanyan Yang', 'Bei Zhang', 'Xiaotong Lin', 'Xiuxiu Fu', 'Yi An', 'Yulin Zou', 'Jianxun Wang', 'Zhibin Wang', 'Tao Yu']",,True

Mendelian randomisation for mediation analysis: current methods and challenges for implementation,"Abstract Mediation analysis seeks to explain the pathway(s) through which an exposure affects an outcome. Traditional, non-instrumental variable methods for mediation analysis experience a number of methodological difficulties, including bias due to confounding between an exposure, mediator and outcome and measurement error. Mendelian randomisation (MR) can be used to improve causal inference for mediation analysis. We describe two approaches that can be used for estimating mediation analysis with MR: multivariable MR (MVMR) and two-step MR. We outline the approaches and provide code to demonstrate how they can be used in mediation analysis. We review issues that can affect analyses, including confounding, measurement error, weak instrument bias, interactions between exposures and mediators and analysis of multiple mediators. Description of the methods is supplemented by simulated and real data examples. Although MR relies on large sample sizes and strong assumptions, such as having strong instruments and no horizontally pleiotropic pathways, our simulations demonstrate that these methods are unaffected by confounders of the exposure or mediator and the outcome and non-differential measurement error of the exposure or mediator.

Single‐cell RNA sequencing technologies and applications: A brief overview,"Abstract Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) technology has become the state‐of‐the‐art approach for unravelling the heterogeneity and complexity of RNA transcripts within individual cells, as well as revealing the composition of different cell types and functions within highly organized tissues/organs/organisms. Since its first discovery in 2009, studies based on scRNA‐seq provide massive information across different fields making exciting new discoveries in better understanding the composition and interaction of cells within humans, model animals and plants. In this review, we provide a concise overview about the scRNA‐seq technology, experimental and computational procedures for transforming the biological and molecular processes into computational and statistical data. We also provide an explanation of the key technological steps in implementing the technology. We highlight a few examples on how scRNA‐seq can provide unique information for better understanding health and diseases. One important application of the scRNA‐seq technology is to build a better and high‐resolution catalogue of cells in all living organism, commonly known as atlas, which is key resource to better understand and provide a solution in treating diseases. While great promises have been demonstrated with the technology in all areas, we further highlight a few remaining challenges to be overcome and its great potentials in transforming current protocols in disease diagnosis and treatment.",2022-03-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.694,1050,5,0.3655478183054397,"['Dragomirka Jovic', 'Xue Liang', 'Zeng Hua', 'Lin Lin', 'Fengping Xu', 'Yonglun Luo']",,True

Federated Learning for Internet of Things: A Comprehensive Survey,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is penetrating many facets of our daily life\nwith the proliferation of intelligent services and applications empowered by\nartificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized\ndata collection and processing that may not be feasible in realistic\napplication scenarios due to the high scalability of modern IoT networks and\ngrowing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a\ndistributed collaborative AI approach that can enable many intelligent IoT\napplications, by allowing for AI training at distributed IoT devices without\nthe need for data sharing. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey\nof the emerging applications of FL in IoT networks, beginning from an\nintroduction to the recent advances in FL and IoT to a discussion of their\nintegration. Particularly, we explore and analyze the potential of FL for\nenabling a wide range of IoT services, including IoT data sharing, data\noffloading and caching, attack detection, localization, mobile crowdsensing,\nand IoT privacy and security. We then provide an extensive survey of the use of\nFL in various key IoT applications such as smart healthcare, smart\ntransportation, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), smart cities, and smart\nindustry. The important lessons learned from this review of the FL-IoT services\nand applications are also highlighted.

Principles for a sustainable circular economy,"The pressure that the human species exerts on the natural environment through the extraction of materials and generation of wastes is widely recognised. Circular economy has emerged as a potential solution to make better use of resources. Positioned as a technology-focused concept that can generate economic gains while alleviating pressure on the environment, circular economy enjoys a positive reception by organisations in public, private and civic sectors and, increasingly, academia alike. However, concerns have been raised regarding some purported circular economy practices being promoted as 'sustainable' yet resulting in detrimental impacts on environment and society. We briefly revisit the systems ecology literature that construed the context for both circular economy and sustainable development. Values and principles in core sustainable development literature are analysed to offer a foundation against which circular economy can be discussed. We then analyse and critically reflect upon the strengths, shortcomings and theoretical flaws within the values and principles that emerged from the evolving circular economy literature. We propose a value framework and set of ten principles for the design, implementation and evaluation of a sustainable circular economy.

DrugBank 6.0: the DrugBank Knowledgebase for 2024,"Abstract First released in 2006, DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com) has grown to become the ‘gold standard’ knowledge resource for drug, drug–target and related pharmaceutical information. DrugBank is widely used across many diverse biomedical research and clinical applications, and averages more than 30 million views/year. Since its last update in 2018, we have been actively enhancing the quantity and quality of the drug data in this knowledgebase. In this latest release (DrugBank 6.0), the number of FDA approved drugs has grown from 2646 to 4563 (a 72% increase), the number of investigational drugs has grown from 3394 to 6231 (a 38% increase), the number of drug–drug interactions increased from 365 984 to 1 413 413 (a 300% increase), and the number of drug–food interactions expanded from 1195 to 2475 (a 200% increase). In addition to this notable expansion in database size, we have added thousands of new, colorful, richly annotated pathways depicting drug mechanisms and drug metabolism. Likewise, existing datasets have been significantly improved and expanded, by adding more information on drug indications, drug–drug interactions, drug–food interactions and many other relevant data types for 11 891 drugs. We have also added experimental and predicted MS/MS spectra, 1D/2D-NMR spectra, CCS (collision cross section), RT (retention time) and RI (retention index) data for 9464 of DrugBank's 11 710 small molecule drugs.

"Breast Cancer Risk Genes — Association Analysis in More than 113,000 Women","BACKGROUND: Genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility is widely used, but for many genes, evidence of an association with breast cancer is weak, underlying risk estimates are imprecise, and reliable subtype-specific risk estimates are lacking. METHODS: We used a panel of 34 putative susceptibility genes to perform sequencing on samples from 60,466 women with breast cancer and 53,461 controls. In separate analyses for protein-truncating variants and rare missense variants in these genes, we estimated odds ratios for breast cancer overall and tumor subtypes. We evaluated missense-variant associations according to domain and classification of pathogenicity. RESULTS: Protein-truncating variants in 5 genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, and PALB2) were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall with a P value of less than 0.0001. Protein-truncating variants in 4 other genes (BARD1, RAD51C, RAD51D, and TP53) were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall with a P value of less than 0.05 and a Bayesian false-discovery probability of less than 0.05. For protein-truncating variants in 19 of the remaining 25 genes, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio for breast cancer overall was less than 2.0. For protein-truncating variants in ATM and CHEK2, odds ratios were higher for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease than for ER-negative disease; for protein-truncating variants in BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D, odds ratios were higher for ER-negative disease than for ER-positive disease. Rare missense variants (in aggregate) in ATM, CHEK2, and TP53 were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall with a P value of less than 0.001. For BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53, missense variants (in aggregate) that would be classified as pathogenic according to standard criteria were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall, with the risk being similar to that of protein-truncating variants. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study define the genes that are most clinically useful for inclusion on panels for the prediction of breast cancer risk, as well as provide estimates of the risks associated with protein-truncating variants, to guide genetic counseling.

Human Inborn Errors of Immunity: 2022 Update on the Classification from the International Union of Immunological Societies Expert Committee,"Abstract We report the updated classification of inborn errors of immunity, compiled by the International Union of Immunological Societies Expert Committee. This report documents the key clinical and laboratory features of 55 novel monogenic gene defects, and 1 phenocopy due to autoantibodies, that have either been discovered since the previous update (published January 2020) or were characterized earlier but have since been confirmed or expanded in subsequent studies. While variants in additional genes associated with immune diseases have been reported in the literature, this update includes only those that the committee assessed that reached the necessary threshold to represent novel inborn errors of immunity. There are now a total of 485 inborn errors of immunity. These advances in discovering the genetic causes of human immune diseases continue to significantly further our understanding of molecular, cellular, and immunological mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, thereby simultaneously enhancing immunological knowledge and improving patient diagnosis and management.

SpectralFormer: Rethinking Hyperspectral Image Classification with\n Transformers,"Hyperspectral (HS) images are characterized by approximately contiguous\nspectral information, enabling the fine identification of materials by\ncapturing subtle spectral discrepancies. Owing to their excellent locally\ncontextual modeling ability, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been\nproven to be a powerful feature extractor in HS image classification. However,\nCNNs fail to mine and represent the sequence attributes of spectral signatures\nwell due to the limitations of their inherent network backbone. To solve this\nissue, we rethink HS image classification from a sequential perspective with\ntransformers, and propose a novel backbone network called \\ul{SpectralFormer}.\nBeyond band-wise representations in classic transformers, SpectralFormer is\ncapable of learning spectrally local sequence information from neighboring\nbands of HS images, yielding group-wise spectral embeddings. More\nsignificantly, to reduce the possibility of losing valuable information in the\nlayer-wise propagation process, we devise a cross-layer skip connection to\nconvey memory-like components from shallow to deep layers by adaptively\nlearning to fuse ""soft"" residuals across layers. It is worth noting that the\nproposed SpectralFormer is a highly flexible backbone network, which can be\napplicable to both pixel- and patch-wise inputs. We evaluate the classification\nperformance of the proposed SpectralFormer on three HS datasets by conducting\nextensive experiments, showing the superiority over classic transformers and\nachieving a significant improvement in comparison with state-of-the-art\nbackbone networks.

LAION-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models,"Groundbreaking language-vision architectures like CLIP and DALL-E proved the utility of training on large amounts of noisy image-text data, without relying on expensive accurate labels used in standard vision unimodal supervised learning. The resulting models showed capabilities of strong text-guided image generation and transfer to downstream tasks, while performing remarkably at zero-shot classification with noteworthy out-of-distribution robustness. Since then, large-scale language-vision models like ALIGN, BASIC, GLIDE, Flamingo and Imagen made further improvements. Studying the training and capabilities of such models requires datasets containing billions of image-text pairs. Until now, no datasets of this size have been made openly available for the broader research community. To address this problem and democratize research on large-scale multi-modal models, we present LAION-5B - a dataset consisting of 5.85 billion CLIP-filtered image-text pairs, of which 2.32B contain English language. We show successful replication and fine-tuning of foundational models like CLIP, GLIDE and Stable Diffusion using the dataset, and discuss further experiments enabled with an openly available dataset of this scale.

Various Natural and Anthropogenic Factors Responsible for Water Quality Degradation: A Review,"Recognition of sustainability issues around water resource consumption is gaining traction under global warming and land utilization complexities. These concerns increase the challenge of gaining an appropriate comprehension of the anthropogenic activities and natural processes, as well as how they influence the quality of surface water and groundwater systems. The characteristics of water resources cause difficulties in the comprehensive assessment regarding the source types, pathways, and pollutants behaviors. As the behavior and prediction of widely known contaminants in the water resources remain challenging, some new issues have developed regarding heavy metal pollutants. The main aim of this review is to focus on certain essential pollutants’ discharge from anthropogenic activities categorized based on land-use sectors such as industrial applications (solid/liquid wastes, chemical compounds, mining activities, spills, and leaks), urban development (municipal wastes, land use practices, and others), and agricultural practices (pesticides and fertilizers). Further, important pollutants released from natural processes classified based on climate change, natural disasters, geological factors, soil/matrix, and hyporheic exchange in the aquatic environment, are also discussed. Moreover, this study addresses the major inorganic substances (nitrogen, fluoride, and heavy metals concentrations).

DIW allows printing of practically any material, as long as the precursor ink can be engineered to demonstrate appropriate rheological behavior. This technique acts as a unique pathway to introduce design freedom, multifunctionality, and stability simultaneously into its printed structures. Here, a comprehensive review of DIW of complex 3D structures from various materials, including polymers, ceramics, glass, cement, graphene, metals, and their combinations through multimaterial printing is presented. The review begins with an overview of the fundamentals of ink rheology, followed by an in‐depth discussion of the various methods to tailor the ink for DIW of different classes of materials.

Bakta: rapid and standardized annotation of bacterial genomes via alignment-free sequence identification,"Command-line annotation software tools have continuously gained popularity compared to centralized online services due to the worldwide increase of sequenced bacterial genomes. However, results of existing command-line software pipelines heavily depend on taxon-specific databases or sufficiently well annotated reference genomes. Here, we introduce Bakta, a new command-line software tool for the robust, taxon-independent, thorough and, nonetheless, fast annotation of bacterial genomes. Bakta conducts a comprehensive annotation workflow including the detection of small proteins taking into account replicon metadata. The annotation of coding sequences is accelerated via an alignment-free sequence identification approach that in addition facilitates the precise assignment of public database cross-references. Annotation results are exported in GFF3 and International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)-compliant flat files, as well as comprehensive JSON files, facilitating automated downstream analysis. We compared Bakta to other rapid contemporary command-line annotation software tools in both targeted and taxonomically broad benchmarks including isolates and metagenomic-assembled genomes. We demonstrated that Bakta outperforms other tools in terms of functional annotations, the assignment of functional categories and database cross-references, whilst providing comparable wall-clock runtimes.

To characterize the performance of the whole system, we perform random quantum circuits sampling for benchmarking, up to a system size of 56 qubits and 20 cycles. The computational cost of the classical simulation of this task is estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the previous work on 53-qubit Sycamore processor [Nature 574, 505 (2019)NATUAS0028-083610.1038/s41586-019-1666-5.

Particle Swarm Optimization: A Comprehensive Survey,"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the most well-regarded swarm-based algorithms in the literature. Although the original PSO has shown good optimization performance, it still severely suffers from premature convergence.

Mainly, the standard PSO has been modified by four main strategies: modification of the PSO controlling parameters, hybridizing PSO with other well-known meta-heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE), cooperation and multi-swarm techniques. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive review of PSO, including the basic concepts of PSO, binary PSO, neighborhood topologies in PSO, recent and historical PSO variants, remarkable engineering applications of PSO, and its drawbacks.

A review of trends and drivers of greenhouse gas emissions by sector from 1990 to 2018,"Abstract Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be traced to five economic sectors: energy, industry, buildings, transport and AFOLU (agriculture, forestry and other land uses). In this topical review, we synthesise the literature to explain recent trends in global and regional emissions in each of these sectors. To contextualise our review, we present estimates of GHG emissions trends by sector from 1990 to 2018, describing the major sources of emissions growth, stability and decline across ten global regions. Overall, the literature and data emphasise that progress towards reducing GHG emissions has been limited. The prominent global pattern is a continuation of underlying drivers with few signs of emerging limits to demand, nor of a deep shift towards the delivery of low and zero carbon services across sectors. We observe a moderate decarbonisation of energy systems in Europe and North America, driven by fuel switching and the increasing penetration of renewables. By contrast, in rapidly industrialising regions, fossil-based energy systems have continuously expanded, only very recently slowing down in their growth. Strong demand for materials, floor area, energy services and travel have driven emissions growth in the industry, buildings and transport sectors, particularly in Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and South-East Asia. An expansion of agriculture into carbon-dense tropical forest areas has driven recent increases in AFOLU emissions in Latin America, South-East Asia and Africa.

Effective gene expression prediction from sequence by integrating long-range interactions,"Abstract How noncoding DNA determines gene expression in different cell types is a major unsolved problem, and critical downstream applications in human genetics depend on improved solutions. Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequences through the use of a deep learning architecture, called Enformer, that is able to integrate information from long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer–promoter interactions directly from the DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations and provide a framework to interpret cis -regulatory evolution.",2021-10-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01252-x,1028,-1,0.11834246318836542,"['Žiga Avsec', 'Vikram Agarwal', 'Daniel Visentin', 'Joseph R.

Lipoprotein(a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis: a European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement,"Abstract This 2022 European Atherosclerosis Society lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] consensus statement updates evidence for the role of Lp(a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and aortic valve stenosis, provides clinical guidance for testing and treating elevated Lp(a) levels, and considers its inclusion in global risk estimation. Epidemiologic and genetic studies involving hundreds of thousands of individuals strongly support a causal and continuous association between Lp(a) concentration and cardiovascular outcomes in different ethnicities; elevated Lp(a) is a risk factor even at very low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. High Lp(a) is associated with both microcalcification and macrocalcification of the aortic valve. Current findings do not support Lp(a) as a risk factor for venous thrombotic events and impaired fibrinolysis. Very low Lp(a) levels may associate with increased risk of diabetes mellitus meriting further study. Lp(a) has pro-inflammatory and pro-atherosclerotic properties, which may partly relate to the oxidized phospholipids carried by Lp(a). This panel recommends testing Lp(a) concentration at least once in adults; cascade testing has potential value in familial hypercholesterolaemia, or with family or personal history of (very) high Lp(a) or premature ASCVD. Without specific Lp(a)-lowering therapies, early intensive risk factor management is recommended, targeted according to global cardiovascular risk and Lp(a) level. Lipoprotein apheresis is an option for very high Lp(a) with progressive cardiovascular disease despite optimal management of risk factors. In conclusion, this statement reinforces evidence for Lp(a) as a causal risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes. Trials of specific Lp(a)-lowering treatments are critical to confirm clinical benefit for cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis.",2022-08-18,2022,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac361,1024,1,0.4985990945489765,"['Florian Kronenberg', 'Samia Mora', 'Erik S.G.

Nonverbal overload: A theoretical argument for the causes of Zoom fatigue.,"For decades, scholars have predicted that videoconference technology will disrupt the practice of commuting daily to and from work and will change the way people socialize.In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic forced a drastic increase in the number of videoconference meetings, and Zoom became the leading software package because it was free, robust, and easy to use.While the software has been an essential tool for productivity, learning, and social interaction, something about being on videoconference all day seems particularly exhausting, and the term ""Zoom Fatigue"" caught on quickly.In this article, I focus on nonverbal overload as a potential cause for fatigue and provide four arguments outlining how various aspects of the current Zoom interface likely lead to psychological consequences.The arguments are based on academic theory and research, but also have yet to be directly tested in the context of Zoom, and require future experimentation to confirm.Instead of indicting the medium, my goal is to point out these design flaws to isolate research areas for social scientists and to suggest design improvements for technologists.",2021-02-23,2021,https://doi.org/10.1037/tmb0000030,1023,-1,0.2306414752173285,['Jeremy N.

SimMIM: a Simple Framework for Masked Image Modeling,"This paper presents SimMIM, a simple framework for masked image modeling. We have simplified recently proposed relevant approaches, without the need for special designs, such as block-wise masking and tokenization via discrete VAE or clustering. To investigate what makes a masked image modeling task learn good representations, we systematically study the major components in our framework, and find that the simple designs of each component have revealed very strong representation learning performance: 1) random masking of the input image with a moderately large masked patch size (e.g., 32) makes a powerful pre-text task; 2) predicting RGB values of raw pixels by direct regression performs no worse than the patch classification approaches with complex designs; 3) the prediction head can be as light as a linear layer, with no worse performance than heavier ones. Using ViT-B, our approach achieves 83.8% top-1 fine-tuning accuracy on ImageNet-1K by pre-training also on this dataset, surpassing previous best approach by +0.6%. When applied to a larger model with about 650 million parameters, SwinV2-H, it achieves 87.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K using only ImageNet-1K data. We also leverage this approach to address the data-hungry issue faced by large-scale model training, that a 3B model (Swin V2-G) is successfully trained to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on four representative vision benchmarks using 40× less labelled data than that in previous practice (JFT-3B).

Spatiotemporal Immune Landscape of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis at Single-Cell Level,"Abstract Liver metastasis, the leading cause of colorectal cancer mortality, exhibits a highly heterogeneous and suppressive immune microenvironment. Here, we sequenced 97 matched samples by using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. Strikingly, the metastatic microenvironment underwent remarkable spatial reprogramming of immunosuppressive cells such as MRC1+ CCL18+ M2-like macrophages. We further developed scMetabolism, a computational pipeline for quantifying single-cell metabolism, and observed that those macrophages harbored enhanced metabolic activity. Interestingly, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could block this status and restore the antitumor immune balance in responsive patients, whereas the nonresponsive patients deteriorated into a more suppressive one. Our work described the immune evolution of metastasis and uncovered the black box of how tumors respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Significance: We present a single-cell and spatial atlas of colorectal liver metastasis and found the highly metabolically activated MRC1+ CCL18+ M2-like macrophages in metastatic sites. Efficient neoadjuvant chemotherapy can slow down such metabolic activation, raising the possibility to target metabolism pathways in metastasis.

"Robot Operating System 2: Design, architecture, and uses in the wild","The next chapter of the robotics revolution is well underway with the deployment of robots for a broad range of commercial use cases. Even in a myriad of applications and environments, there exists a common vocabulary of components that robots share—the need for a modular, scalable, and reliable architecture; sensing; planning; mobility; and autonomy. The Robot Operating System (ROS) was an integral part of the last chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely available components and a modular framework. However, ROS 1 was not designed with many necessary production-grade features and algorithms. ROS 2 and its related projects have been redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at all scales.

SwinFusion: Cross-domain Long-range Learning for General Image Fusion via Swin Transformer,"This study proposes a novel general image fusion framework based on cross-domain long-range learning and Swin Transformer, termed as SwinFusion. On the one hand, an attention-guided cross-domain module is devised to achieve sufficient integration of complementary information and global interaction. More specifically, the proposed method involves an intra-domain fusion unit based on self-attention and an inter-domain fusion unit based on cross-attention, which mine and integrate long dependencies within the same domain and across domains. Through long-range dependency modeling, the network is able to fully implement domain-specific information extraction and cross-domain complementary information integration as well as maintaining the appropriate apparent intensity from a global perspective. In particular, we introduce the shifted windows mechanism into the self-attention and cross-attention, which allows our model to receive images with arbitrary sizes. On the other hand, the multi-scene image fusion problems are generalized to a unified framework with structure maintenance, detail preservation, and proper intensity control. Moreover, an elaborate loss function, consisting of SSIM loss, texture loss, and intensity loss, drives the network to preserve abundant texture details and structural information, as well as presenting optimal apparent intensity. Extensive experiments on both multi-modal image fusion and digital photography image fusion demonstrate the superiority of our SwinFusion compared to the state-of-the-art unified image fusion algorithms and task-specific alternatives.

CodeT5: Identifier-aware Unified Pre-trained Encoder-Decoder Models for Code Understanding and Generation,"Pre-trained models for Natural Languages (NL) like BERT and GPT have been recently shown to transfer well to Programming Languages (PL) and largely benefit a broad set of code-related tasks. Despite their success, most current methods either rely on an encoder-only (or decoder-only) pre-training that is suboptimal for generation (resp. understanding) tasks or process the code snippet in the same way as NL, neglecting the special characteristics of PL such as token types. We present CodeT5, a unified pre-trained encoder-decoder Transformer model that better leverages the code semantics conveyed from the developer-assigned identifiers. Our model employs a unified framework to seamlessly support both code understanding and generation tasks and allows for multi-task learning. Besides, we propose a novel identifier-aware pre-training task that enables the model to distinguish which code tokens are identifiers and to recover them when they are masked. Furthermore, we propose to exploit the user-written code comments with a bimodal dual generation task for better NL-PL alignment. Comprehensive experiments show that CodeT5 significantly outperforms prior methods on understanding tasks such as code defect detection and clone detection, and generation tasks across various directions including PL-NL, NL-PL, and PL-PL. Further analysis reveals that our model can better capture semantic information from code.

Leveraging the unique properties of reticular materials has resulted in significant advances from both a fundamental and an applied perspective. Here, we wish to review the milestones in MOF and COF research and give a critical view on progress in their real‐world applications.

Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic Health: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association,"Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health reflects the interplay among metabolic risk factors, chronic kidney disease, and the cardiovascular system and has profound impacts on morbidity and mortality. There are multisystem consequences of poor cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health, with the most significant clinical impact being the high associated incidence of cardiovascular disease events and cardiovascular mortality. There is a high prevalence of poor cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health in the population, with a disproportionate burden seen among those with adverse social determinants of health. However, there is also a growing number of therapeutic options that favorably affect metabolic risk factors, kidney function, or both that also have cardioprotective effects. To improve cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health and related outcomes in the population, there is a critical need for (1) more clarity on the definition of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome; (2) an approach to cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic staging that promotes prevention across the life course; (3) prediction algorithms that include the exposures and outcomes most relevant to cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health; and (4) strategies for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease in relation to cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health that reflect harmonization across major subspecialty guidelines and emerging scientific evidence. It is also critical to incorporate considerations of social determinants of health into care models for cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome and to reduce care fragmentation by facilitating approaches for patient-centered interdisciplinary care.

Carbon Nitride Supported High‐Loading Fe Single‐Atom Catalyst for Activation of Peroxymonosulfate to Generate <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> with 100 % Selectivity,"Abstract Singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) is an excellent active species for the selective degradation of organic pollutions. However, it is difficult to achieve high efficiency and selectivity for the generation of 1 O 2 . In this work, we develop a graphitic carbon nitride supported Fe single‐atoms catalyst (Fe 1 /CN) containing highly uniform Fe‐N 4 active sites with a high Fe loading of 11.2 wt %. The Fe 1 /CN achieves generation of 100 % 1 O 2 by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), which shows an ultrahigh p‐chlorophenol degradation efficiency. Density functional theory calculations results demonstrate that in contrast to Co and Ni single‐atom sites, the Fe‐N 4 sites in Fe 1 /CN adsorb the terminal O of PMS, which can facilitate the oxidization of PMS to form SO 5 .− , and thereafter efficiently generate 1 O 2 with 100 % selectivity. In addition, the Fe 1 /CN exhibits strong resistance to inorganic ions, natural organic matter, and pH value during the degradation of organic pollutants in the presence of PMS.

Successful protests bring masses to the streets, and the emergence of social media has fundamentally changed the process of mobilization. What protests need to be successful is demand (grievances, anger, and indignation), supply (protest organizations), and mobilization (eﬀective communication networks). Motivation to participate can be instrumental, expressive, and identity driven, and politicized collective identity plays an important role in the dynamics of collective action. This volume brings together insights from social psychology, political psychology, sociology, and political science to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of protest participation, particularly to the question of why some people protest while others do not. It is essential reading for scholars interested in the social and political psychology of individuals in action.",2023-11-23,2023,https://doi.org/10.1017/9781316823354,1008,2,1.0,"['Jacquelien van Stekelenburg', 'Bert Klandermans']",,False

Transformer in Transformer,"Transformer is a new kind of neural architecture which encodes the input data as powerful features via the attention mechanism. Basically, the visual transformers first divide the input images into several local patches and then calculate both representations and their relationship. Since natural images are of high complexity with abundant detail and color information, the granularity of the patch dividing is not fine enough for excavating features of objects in different scales and locations. In this paper, we point out that the attention inside these local patches are also essential for building visual transformers with high performance and we explore a new architecture, namely, Transformer iN Transformer (TNT). Specifically, we regard the local patches (e.g., 16$\times$16) as ""visual sentences"" and present to further divide them into smaller patches (e.g., 4$\times$4) as ""visual words"". The attention of each word will be calculated with other words in the given visual sentence with negligible computational costs. Features of both words and sentences will be aggregated to enhance the representation ability. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TNT architecture, e.g., we achieve an 81.5% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet, which is about 1.7% higher than that of the state-of-the-art visual transformer with similar computational cost.

Long-Term Outcomes With Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab or Nivolumab Alone Versus Ipilimumab in Patients With Advanced Melanoma,"PURPOSE In the phase III CheckMate 067 trial, durable clinical benefit was demonstrated previously with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and nivolumab alone versus ipilimumab. Here, we report 6.5-year efficacy and safety outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with previously untreated unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (four doses) followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (n = 314), nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (n = 316), or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (four doses; n = 315). Coprimary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab versus ipilimumab. Secondary end points included objective response rate, descriptive efficacy assessments of nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone, and safety. Melanoma-specific survival (MSS; descriptive analysis), which excludes deaths unrelated to melanoma, was also evaluated. RESULTS Median OS (minimum follow-up, 6.5 years) was 72.1, 36.9, and 19.9 months in the combination, nivolumab, and ipilimumab groups, respectively. Median MSS was not reached, 58.7, and 21.9 months, respectively; 6.5-year OS rates were 57%, 43%, and 25% in patients with BRAF-mutant tumors and 46%, 42%, and 22% in those with BRAF–wild-type tumors, respectively. In patients who discontinued treatment, the median treatment-free interval was 27.6, 2.3, and 1.9 months, respectively. Since the 5-year analysis, no new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSION These 6.5-year CheckMate 067 results, which include the longest median OS in a phase III melanoma trial reported to date and the first report of MSS, showed durable, improved clinical outcomes with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma and, in descriptive analyses, with the combination over nivolumab monotherapy.",2021-11-24,2021,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.21.02229,1006,3,0.469301013660143,"['Jedd D.

Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Molecular Simulation,"Abstract Complex problems that cross traditional disciplinary lines between physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science can be studied at an unprecedented level of detail using increasingly sophisticated theoretical methodology and high-speed computing platforms. The tools of statistical mechanics provide the bridge between the atomistic descriptions of these complex systems and the macroscopic observables accessible to experimental investigations and predictable in computer simulations. The aim of this book is to prepare burgeoning users and developers to become active researchers in the theoretical and computational molecular sciences by uniting, in one monograph, the theoretical underpinnings of equilibrium and time-dependent classical and quantum statistical mechanics with modern computational techniques used to put these concepts into practice to address real-world applications. The book contains detailed reviews of classical and quantum mechanics and in-depth discussions of the most commonly used statistical ensembles side by side with modern computational methods such as molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, advanced configurational and trajectory sampling approaches, free-energy based rare-event sampling approaches, Feynman path integral techniques, linear response theory and time correlation functions, stochastic methods, critical phenomena, and an introduction to machine learning and its uses in statistical mechanics. Readers of this book will be provided, in a pedagogical manner, with a firm foundation in both the theory and practical implementation of statistical mechanical concepts, thus allowing them to approach application technology with an understanding of the underlying algorithms and to become, themselves, creators of new and powerful approaches for solving challenging research problems.",2023-08-01,2023,https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198825562.001.0001,1006,4,1.0,['Mark E.

Hypoxic microenvironment in cancer: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic interventions,"Abstract Having a hypoxic microenvironment is a common and salient feature of most solid tumors. Hypoxia has a profound effect on the biological behavior and malignant phenotype of cancer cells, mediates the effects of cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy through complex mechanisms, and is closely associated with poor prognosis in various cancer patients. Accumulating studies have demonstrated that through normalization of the tumor vasculature, nanoparticle carriers and biocarriers can effectively increase the oxygen concentration in the tumor microenvironment, improve drug delivery and the efficacy of radiotherapy. They also increase infiltration of innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune cells to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. Furthermore, drugs targeting key genes associated with hypoxia, including hypoxia tracers, hypoxia-activated prodrugs, and drugs targeting hypoxia-inducible factors and downstream targets, can be used for visualization and quantitative analysis of tumor hypoxia and antitumor activity. However, the relationship between hypoxia and cancer is an area of research that requires further exploration. Here, we investigated the potential factors in the development of hypoxia in cancer, changes in signaling pathways that occur in cancer cells to adapt to hypoxic environments, the mechanisms of hypoxia-induced cancer immune tolerance, chemotherapeutic tolerance, and enhanced radiation tolerance, as well as the insights and applications of hypoxia in cancer therapy.",2023-02-17,2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01332-8,1006,3,0.5920633118072138,"['Zhou Chen', 'Fangfang Han', 'Yan Du', 'Huaqing Shi', 'Wence Zhou']",,True

Technology Roadmap for Flexible Sensors,"Humans rely increasingly on sensors to address grand challenges and to improve quality of life in the era of digitalization and big data. For ubiquitous sensing, flexible sensors are developed to overcome the limitations of conventional rigid counterparts. Despite rapid advancement in bench-side research over the last decade, the market adoption of flexible sensors remains limited. To ease and to expedite their deployment, here, we identify bottlenecks hindering the maturation of flexible sensors and propose promising solutions. We first analyze challenges in achieving satisfactory sensing performance for real-world applications and then summarize issues in compatible sensor-biology interfaces, followed by brief discussions on powering and connecting sensor networks. Issues en route to commercialization and for sustainable growth of the sector are also analyzed, highlighting environmental concerns and emphasizing nontechnical issues such as business, regulatory, and ethical considerations. Additionally, we look at future intelligent flexible sensors.

"Grassland soil carbon sequestration: Current understanding, challenges, and solutions","Grasslands store approximately one third of the global terrestrial carbon stocks and can act as an important soil carbon sink.

Improved grazing management and biodiversity restoration can provide low-cost and/or high-carbon-gain options for natural climate solutions in global grasslands. The achievable SOC sequestration potential in global grasslands is 2.3 to 7.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year (CO 2 e year −1 ) for biodiversity restoration, 148 to 699 megatons of CO 2 e year −1 for improved grazing management, and 147 megatons of CO 2 e year −1 for sown legumes in pasturelands.",2022-08-04,2022,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abo2380,1003,2,1.0,"['Yongfei Bai', 'M.

To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these images have high quality pixel-level annotations; 20000 additional images have coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of weakly-labeled data. Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity. Our accompanying empirical study provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, as well as a performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark.",2024-01-01,2024,https://doi.org/10.57702/tuq85ufq,1002,0,0.6079339069947761,"['Marius Cordts', 'Mohamed Omran', 'Sebastian Ramos', 'Timo Rehfeld', 'Markus Enzweiler', 'Rodrigo Benenson', 'Uwe Franke', 'Stefan Roth', 'Bernt Schiele']",,True
New tools for automated cryo-EM single-particle analysis in RELION-4.0,"We describe new tools for the processing of electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) images in the fourth major release of the RELION software. In particular, we introduce VDAM, a variable-metric gradient descent algorithm with adaptive moments estimation, for image refinement; a convolutional neural network for unsupervised selection of 2D classes; and a flexible framework for the design and execution of multiple jobs in pre-defined workflows. In addition, we present a stand-alone utility called MDCatch that links the execution of jobs within this framework with metadata gathering during microscope data acquisition. The new tools are aimed at providing fast and robust procedures for unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination, with potential applications for on-the-fly processing and the development of flexible, high-throughput structure determination pipelines. We illustrate their potential on 12 publicly available cryo-EM data sets.",2021-11-16,2021,https://doi.org/10.1042/bcj20210708,1001,0,0.3303678082562888,"['Dari Kimanius', 'Liyi Dong', 'Grigory Sharov', 'Takanori Nakane', 'Sjors H.

"Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS): Principles, Construction, and Biosensing Applications","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful technique used for the analysis of interfacial properties related to bio-recognition events occurring at the electrode surface, such as antibody–antigen recognition, substrate–enzyme interaction, or whole cell capturing. Thus, EIS could be exploited in several important biomedical diagnosis and environmental applications. However, the EIS is one of the most complex electrochemical methods, therefore, this review introduced the basic concepts and the theoretical background of the impedimetric technique along with the state of the art of the impedimetric biosensors and the impact of nanomaterials on the EIS performance. The use of nanomaterials such as nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanowires, and nanocomposites provided catalytic activity, enhanced sensing elements immobilization, promoted faster electron transfer, and increased reliability and accuracy of the reported EIS sensors. Thus, the EIS was used for the effective quantitative and qualitative detections of pathogens, DNA, cancer-associated biomarkers, etc. Through this review article, intensive literature review is provided to highlight the impact of nanomaterials on enhancing the analytical features of impedimetric biosensors.",2021-10-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21196578,1001,4,0.6331031146537808,"['Hend S.

Intelligent Clinical Documentation: Harnessing Generative AI for Patient-Centric Clinical Note Generation,"Comprehensive clinical documentation is crucial for effective healthcare delivery, yet it poses a significant burden on healthcare professionals, leading to burnout, increased medical errors, and compromised patient safety. This paper explores the potential of generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to streamline the clinical documentation process, specifically focusing on generating SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) and BIRP (Behavior, Intervention, Response, Plan) notes. We present a case study demonstrating the application of natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies to transcribe patient-clinician interactions, coupled with advanced prompting techniques to generate draft clinical notes using large language models (LLMs). The study highlights the benefits of this approach, including time savings, improved documentation quality, and enhanced patient-centered care. Additionally, we discuss ethical considerations, such as maintaining patient confidentiality and addressing model biases, underscoring the need for responsible deployment of generative AI in healthcare settings. The findings suggest that generative AI has the potential to revolutionize clinical documentation practices, alleviating administrative burdens and enabling healthcare professionals to focus more on direct patient care.",2024-05-28,2024,https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24may1483,1000,0,0.6069687135691413,"['Anjanava Biswas', 'Wrick Talukdar']",,True
Search for an Isotropic Gravitational-wave Background with the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array,"Abstract Pulsar timing arrays aim to detect nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). A background of GWs modulates pulsar arrival times and manifests as a stochastic process, common to all pulsars, with a signature spatial correlation. Here we describe a search for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) using observations of 30 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), which spans 18 yr.

Global patterns of breast cancer incidence and mortality: A population‐based cancer registry data analysis from 2000 to 2020,"Abstract Background Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide but has patterns and trends which vary in different countries. This study aimed to evaluate the global patterns of breast cancer incidence and mortality and analyze its temporal trends for breast cancer prevention and control. Methods Breast cancer incidence and mortality data in 2020 were obtained from the GLOBOCAN online database. Continued data from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Time Trends, the International Agency for Research on cancer mortality and China National Central Cancer Registry were used to analyze the time trends from 2000 to 2015 through Joinpoint regression, and annual average percent changes of breast cancer incidence and mortality were calculated. Association between Human Development Index and breast cancer incidence and mortality were estimated by linear regression. Results There were approximately 2.3 million new breast cancer cases and 685,000 breast cancer deaths worldwide in 2020. Its incidence and mortality varied among countries, with the age‐standardized incidence ranging from the highest of 112.3 per 100,000 population in Belgium to the lowest of 35.8 per 100,000 population in Iran, and the age‐standardized mortality from the highest of 41.0 per 100,000 population in Fiji to the lowest of 6.4 per 100,000 population in South Korea. The peak age of breast cancer in some Asian and African countries were over 10 years earlier than in European or American countries. As for the trends of breast cancer, the age‐standardized incidence rates significantly increased in China and South Korea but decreased in the United States of America (USA) during 2000‐2012. Meanwhile, the age‐standardized mortality rates significantly increased in China and South Korea but decreased in the United Kingdom, the USA, and Australia during 2000 and 2015. Conclusions The global burden of breast cancer is rising fast and varies greatly among countries. The incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer increased rapidly in China and South Korea but decreased in the USA. Increased health awareness, effective prevention strategies, and improved access to medical treatment are extremely important to curb the snowballing breast cancer burden, especially in the most affected countries.",2021-08-16,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/cac2.12207,1000,3,1.0,"['Shaoyuan Lei', 'Rongshou Zheng', 'Siwei Zhang', 'Shaoming Wang', 'Ru Chen', 'Kexin Sun', 'Hongmei Zeng', 'Jiachen Zhou', 'Wenqiang Wei']",,True

The Psychology of Fake News,"We synthesize a burgeoning literature investigating why people believe and share false or highly misleading news online. Contrary to a common narrative whereby politics drives susceptibility to fake news, people are 'better' at discerning truth from falsehood (despite greater overall belief) when evaluating politically concordant news. Instead, poor truth discernment is associated with lack of careful reasoning and relevant knowledge, and the use of heuristics such as familiarity. Furthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention, more so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, interventions can successfully nudge social media users to focus more on accuracy. Crowdsourced veracity ratings can also be leveraged to improve social media ranking algorithms.",2021-03-18,2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2021.02.007,998,-1,0.07014490556582928,"['Gordon Pennycook', 'David G.

Attentional Feature Fusion,"Feature fusion, the combination of features from different layers or branches, is an omnipresent part of modern network architectures. It is often implemented via simple operations, such as summation or concatenation, but this might not be the best choice. In this work, we propose a uniform and general scheme, namely attentional feature fusion, which is applicable for most common scenarios, including feature fusion induced by short and long skip connections as well as within Inception layers. To better fuse features of inconsistent semantics and scales, we propose a multiscale channel attention module, which addresses issues that arise when fusing features given at different scales. We also demonstrate that the initial integration of feature maps can become a bottleneck and that this issue can be alleviated by adding another level of attention, which we refer to as iterative attentional feature fusion. With fewer layers or parameters, our models outperform state-of-the-art networks on both CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, which suggests that more sophisticated attention mechanisms for feature fusion hold great potential to consistently yield better results compared to their direct counterparts.

Best practice guidance and reporting items for the development of scoping review protocols,"ABSTRACT Objective: The purpose of this article is to clearly describe how to develop a robust and detailed scoping review protocol, which is the first stage of the scoping review process. This paper provides detailed guidance and a checklist for prospective authors to ensure that their protocols adequately inform both the conduct of the ensuing review and their readership. Introduction: Scoping reviews are a common approach to evidence synthesis for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers across a variety of fields. Scoping reviews are not concerned with making analytical comparisons based on pooling results data from multiple primary sources of evidence, but rather on collating and describing the evidence and presenting the summation in a clearly illustrated format. Methods for undertaking and reporting scoping reviews continue to be refined. Some prospective reviewers may be uncertain how to plan, structure, and report scoping review protocols, as there is little or no specific guidance for scoping review protocols yet available. Methods: This guidance was developed by members of the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group based on previous experience and expertise in developing scoping review and evidence synthesis methodologies, protocols, and reviews, as well as through experiences working with and guiding authors to develop scoping review protocols. Elements of a comprehensive scoping review protocol are outlined and explained in detail. Conclusion: Knowledge users of evidence syntheses rely on clear and transparent reporting to understand and use the results of published work to drive evidence-based improvements within health care and beyond. It is hoped that readers will be able to use this guidance when developing protocols to assist them in planning future scoping reviews and to carry them out with a high degree of transparency.",2022-02-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.11124/jbies-21-00242,997,2,0.29226884746301995,"['Micah D.J.

Digital Transformation: An Overview of the Current State of the Art of Research,"The increasing digitalization of economies has highlighted the importance of digital transformation and how it can help businesses stay competitive in the market. However, disruptive changes not only occur at the company level; they also have environmental, societal, and institutional implications. This is the reason why during the past two decades the research on digital transformation has received growing attention, with a wide range of topics investigated in the literature. The following aims to provide insight regarding the current state of the literature on digital transformation (DT) by conducting a systematic literature review. An analysis of co-occurrence using the software VOSviewer was conducted to graphically visualize the literature’s node network. Approached this way, the systematic literature review displays major research avenues of digital transformation that consider technology as the main driver of these changes.

Personalized RNA neoantigen vaccines stimulate T cells in pancreatic cancer,"Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is lethal in 88% of patients 1 , yet harbours mutation-derived T cell neoantigens that are suitable for vaccines 2,3 . Here in a phase I trial of adjuvant autogene cevumeran, an individualized neoantigen vaccine based on uridine mRNA–lipoplex nanoparticles, we synthesized mRNA neoantigen vaccines in real time from surgically resected PDAC tumours. After surgery, we sequentially administered atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy), autogene cevumeran (a maximum of 20 neoantigens per patient) and a modified version of a four-drug chemotherapy regimen (mFOLFIRINOX, comprising folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin). The end points included vaccine-induced neoantigen-specific T cells by high-threshold assays, 18-month recurrence-free survival and oncologic feasibility. We treated 16 patients with atezolizumab and autogene cevumeran, then 15 patients with mFOLFIRINOX. Autogene cevumeran was administered within 3 days of benchmarked times, was tolerable and induced de novo high-magnitude neoantigen-specific T cells in 8 out of 16 patients, with half targeting more than one vaccine neoantigen. Using a new mathematical strategy to track T cell clones (CloneTrack) and functional assays, we found that vaccine-expanded T cells comprised up to 10% of all blood T cells, re-expanded with a vaccine booster and included long-lived polyfunctional neoantigen-specific effector CD8 + T cells. At 18-month median follow-up, patients with vaccine-expanded T cells (responders) had a longer median recurrence-free survival (not reached) compared with patients without vaccine-expanded T cells (non-responders; 13.4 months, P = 0.003). Differences in the immune fitness of the patients did not confound this correlation, as responders and non-responders mounted equivalent immunity to a concurrent unrelated mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, adjuvant atezolizumab, autogene cevumeran and mFOLFIRINOX induces substantial T cell activity that may correlate with delayed PDAC recurrence.",2023-05-10,2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06063-y,996,3,1.0,"['Luis A.

European Society of Cardiology: cardiovascular disease statistics 2021,"Abstract Aims This report from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Atlas Project updates and expands upon the widely cited 2019 report in presenting cardiovascular disease (CVD) statistics for the 57 ESC member countries. Methods and results Statistics pertaining to 2019, or the latest available year, are presented. Data sources include the World Health Organization, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the World Bank, and novel ESC sponsored data on human and capital infrastructure and cardiovascular healthcare delivery. New material in this report includes sociodemographic and environmental determinants of CVD, rheumatic heart disease, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, left-sided valvular heart disease, the advocacy potential of these CVD statistics, and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) 2025 targets for non-communicable diseases. Salient observations in this report: (i) Females born in ESC member countries in 2018 are expected to live 80.8 years and males 74.8 years. Life expectancy is longer in high income (81.6 years) compared with middle-income (74.2 years) countries. (ii) In 2018, high-income countries spent, on average, four times more on healthcare than middle-income countries. (iii) The median PM2.5 concentrations in 2019 were over twice as high in middle-income ESC member countries compared with high-income countries and exceeded the EU air quality standard in 14 countries, all middle-income. (iv) In 2016, more than one in five adults across the ESC member countries were obese with similar prevalence in high and low-income countries. The prevalence of obesity has more than doubled over the past 35 years. (v) The burden of CVD falls hardest on middle-income ESC member countries where estimated incidence rates are ∼30% higher compared with high-income countries. This is reflected in disability-adjusted life years due to CVD which are nearly four times as high in middle-income compared with high-income countries. (vi) The incidence of calcific aortic valve disease has increased seven-fold during the last 30 years, with age-standardized rates four times as high in high-income compared with middle-income countries. (vii) Although the total number of CVD deaths across all countries far exceeds the number of cancer deaths for both sexes, there are 15 ESC member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in males and five-member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in females. (viii) The under-resourced status of middle-income countries is associated with a severe procedural deficit compared with high-income countries in terms of coronary intervention, ablation procedures, device implantation, and cardiac surgical procedures. Conclusion Risk factors and unhealthy behaviours are potentially reversible, and this provides a huge opportunity to address the health inequalities across ESC member countries that are highlighted in this report. It seems clear, however, that efforts to seize this opportunity are falling short and present evidence suggests that most of the WHO NCD targets for 2025 are unlikely to be met across ESC member countries.",2021-12-20,2021,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab892,996,1,0.5190528065429809,"['Adam Timmis', 'Panos Vardas', 'Nick Townsend', 'Aleksandra Torbica', 'Hugo A.

"Trends and Geographic Patterns in Drug and Synthetic Opioid Overdose Deaths — United States, 2013–2019","Deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (synthetic opioids), which largely consist of illicitly manufactured fentanyl; psychostimulants with abuse potential (e.g., methamphetamine); and cocaine have increased in recent years, particularly since 2013 (1,2). In 2019, a total of 70,630 drug overdose deaths occurred, corresponding to an age-adjusted rate of 21.6 per 100,000 population and a 4.3% increase from the 2018 rate (20.7) (3). CDC analyzed trends in age-adjusted overdose death rates involving synthetic opioids, psychostimulants, cocaine, heroin, and prescription opioids during 2013-2019, as well as geographic patterns in synthetic opioid- and psychostimulant-involved deaths during 2018-2019. From 2013 to 2019, the synthetic opioid-involved death rate increased 1,040%, from 1.0 to 11.4 per 100,000 age-adjusted (3,105 to 36,359). The psychostimulant-involved death rate increased 317%, from 1.2 (3,627) in 2013 to 5.0 (16,167) in 2019. In the presence of synthetic opioid coinvolvement, death rates for prescription opioids, heroin, psychostimulants, and cocaine increased. In the absence of synthetic opioid coinvolvement, death rates increased only for psychostimulants and cocaine. From 2018 to 2019, the largest relative increase in the synthetic opioid-involved death rate occurred in the West (67.9%), and the largest relative increase in the psychostimulant-involved death rate occurred in the Northeast (43.8%); these increases represent important changes in the geographic distribution of drug overdose deaths.

Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA): A Comprehensive Resource with Functional Genomic Data from Chinese Glioma Patients,"Abstract Gliomas are the most common and malignant intracranial tumors in adults. Recent studies have revealed the significance of functional genomics for glioma pathophysiological studies and treatments. However, access to comprehensive genomic data and analytical platforms is often limited. Here, we developed the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), a user-friendly data portal for the storage and interactive exploration of cross-omics data, including nearly 2000 primary and recurrent glioma samples from Chinese cohort. Currently, open access is provided to whole-exome sequencing data (286 samples), mRNA sequencing (1018 samples) and microarray data (301 samples), DNA methylation microarray data (159 samples), and microRNA microarray data (198 samples), and to detailed clinical information (age, gender, chemoradiotherapy status, WHO grade, histological type, critical molecular pathological information, and survival data). In addition, we have developed several tools for users to analyze the mutation profiles, mRNA/microRNA expression, and DNA methylation profiles, and to perform survival and gene correlation analyses of specific glioma subtypes. This database removes the barriers for researchers, providing rapid and convenient access to high-quality functional genomic data resources for biological studies and clinical applications.

GLIDE: Towards Photorealistic Image Generation and Editing with Text-Guided Diffusion Models,"Diffusion models have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic images, especially when paired with a guidance technique to trade off diversity for fidelity. We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional image synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human evaluators for both photorealism and caption similarity, and often produces photorealistic samples. Samples from a 3.5 billion parameter text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance are favored by human evaluators to those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses expensive CLIP reranking. Additionally, we find that our models can be fine-tuned to perform image inpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing.

Design of liposomes as drug delivery system for therapeutic applications,"Liposomes are spherical vesicles consisting of one or more concentric phospholipid bilayers enclosing an aqueous core. Being both nontoxic and biodegradable, liposomes represent a powerful delivery system for several drugs. They have improved the therapeutic efficacy of drugs through stabilizing compounds, overcoming obstacles to cellular and tissue uptake and increasing drug biodistribution to target sites in vivo, while minimizing systemic toxicity. This review offers an overview of liposomes, thought the exploration of their key fundamentals. Initially, the main design aspects to obtain a successful liposomal formulation were addressed, following the techniques for liposome production and drug loading. Before application, liposomes required an extensive characterization to assurance in vitro and in vivo performance. Thus, several properties to characterize liposomes were explored, such as size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, shape, lamellarity, phase behavior, encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro drug release. Topics related with liposomal functionalization and effective targeting strategies were also addressed, as well as stability and some limitations of liposomes.

Prevalence Trends of Site‐Specific Osteoarthritis From 1990 to 2019: Findings From the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019,"Objective To estimate systematic and anatomic site–specific age‐standardized prevalence rates (ASRs) and analyze the secular trends of osteoarthritis (OA) at global, regional, and national levels. Methods Data were derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. ASRs and their estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were used to describe the secular trends of OA according to age group, sex, region, country, and territory, as well as the joints involved. Results Globally, prevalent cases of OA increased by 113.25%, from 247.51 million in 1990 to 527.81 million in 2019. ASRs were 6,173.38 per 100,000 in 1990 and 6,348.25 per 100,000 in 2019, with an average annual increase of 0.12% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.11%, 0.14%). The ASR of OA increased for the knee, hip, and other joints, but decreased for the hand, with EAPCs of 0.32 (95% CI 0.29, 0.34), 0.28 (95% CI 0.26, 0.31), 0.18 (95% CI 0.18, 0.19), and −0.36 (95% CI −0.38, −0.33), respectively. OA prevalence increased with age and revealed female preponderance, geographic diversity, and disparity with regard to anatomic site. OA of the knee contributed the most to the overall burden, while OA of the hip had the highest EAPC in most regions. Conclusion OA has remained a major public health concern worldwide over the past decades. The prevalence of OA has increased and diversified by geographic location and affected joint.

"Photodynamic Therapy Review: Principles, Photosensitizers, Applications, and Future Directions","Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive therapeutic modality that has gained great attention in the past years as a new therapy for cancer treatment. PDT uses photosensitizers that, after being excited by light at a specific wavelength, react with the molecular oxygen to create reactive oxygen species in the target tissue, resulting in cell death. Compared to conventional therapeutic modalities, PDT presents greater selectivity against tumor cells, due to the use of photosensitizers that are preferably localized in tumor lesions, and the precise light irradiation of these lesions. This paper presents a review of the principles, mechanisms, photosensitizers, and current applications of PDT. Moreover, the future path on the research of new photosensitizers with enhanced tumor selectivity, featuring the improvement of PDT effectiveness, has also been addressed.

Effect of Continued Weekly Subcutaneous Semaglutide vs Placebo on Weight Loss Maintenance in Adults With Overweight or Obesity,"Importance The effect of continuing vs withdrawing treatment with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, on weight loss maintenance in people with overweight or obesity is unknown. Objective To compare continued once-weekly treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, with switch to placebo for weight maintenance (both with lifestyle intervention) in adults with overweight or obesity after a 20-week run-in with subcutaneous semaglutide titrated to 2.4 mg weekly. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized, double-blind, 68-week phase 3a withdrawal study conducted at 73 sites in 10 countries from June 2018 to March 2020 in adults with body mass index of at least 30 (or ≥27 with ≥1 weight-related comorbidity) and without diabetes. Interventions A total of 902 participants received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide during run-in. After 20 weeks (16 weeks of dose escalation; 4 weeks of maintenance dose), 803 participants (89.0%) who reached the 2.4-mg/wk semaglutide maintenance dose were randomized (2:1) to 48 weeks of continued subcutaneous semaglutide (n = 535) or switched to placebo (n = 268), plus lifestyle intervention in both groups. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was percent change in body weight from week 20 to week 68; confirmatory secondary end points were changes in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning (assessed using the Short Form 36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version [SF-36]). Results Among 803 study participants who completed the 20-week run-in period (with a mean weight loss of 10.6%) and were randomized (mean age, 46 [SD, 12] years; 634 [79%] women; mean body weight, 107.2 kg [SD, 22.7 kg]), 787 participants (98.0%) completed the trial and 741 (92.3%) completed treatment. With continued semaglutide, mean body weight change from week 20 to week 68 was −7.9% vs +6.9% with the switch to placebo (difference, −14.8 [95% CI, −16.0 to −13.5] percentage points; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). Waist circumference (−9.7 cm [95% CI, −10.9 to −8.5 cm]), systolic blood pressure (−3.9 mm Hg [95% CI, −5.8 to −2.0 mm Hg]), and SF-36 physical functioning score (2.5 [95% CI, 1.6-3.3]) also improved with continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo (all P &amp;amp;lt; .001). Gastrointestinal events were reported in 41.9% of participants who continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs 26.1% with placebo; similar proportions discontinued treatment because of adverse events with continued semaglutide (2.4%) and placebo (2.2%). Conclusions and Relevance Among adults with overweight or obesity who completed a 20-week run-in period with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg once weekly, maintaining treatment with semaglutide compared with switching to placebo resulted in continued weight loss over the following 48 weeks.

CAR T cells produced in vivo to treat cardiac injury,"Making CAR T cells in vivo Cardiac fibrosis is the stiffening and scarring of heart tissue and can be fatal. Rurik et al . designed an immunotherapy strategy to generate transient chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that can recognize the fibrotic cells in the heart (see the Perspective by Gao and Chen). By injecting CD5-targeted lipid nanoparticles containing the messenger RNA (mRNA) instructions needed to reprogram T lymphocytes, the researchers were able to generate therapeutic CAR T cells entirely inside the body. Analysis of a mouse model of heart disease revealed that the approach was successful in reducing fibrosis and restoring cardiac function. The ability to produce CAR T cells in vivo using modified mRNA may have a number of therapeutic applications. —PNK",2022-01-06,2022,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm0594,993,-1,0.2438004342103711,"['Joel G.

MetaFormer is Actually What You Need for Vision,"Transformers have shown great potential in computer vision tasks. A common belief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their competence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in transformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still perform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general architecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module, is more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately replace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple spatial pooling operator to conduct only basic token mixing. Surprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves competitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on ImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1 % top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned vision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy with 35%/52% fewer parameters and 49%/61% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of Pool-Former verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of ""MetaFormer"", a general architecture abstracted from transformers without specifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that MetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent transformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more future research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the token mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a starting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design.",2022-06-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr52688.2022.01055,987,0,0.8071324416824611,"['Weihao Yu', 'Mi Luo', 'Pan Zhou', 'Chenyang Si', 'Yichen Zhou', 'Xinchao Wang', 'Jiashi Feng', 'Shuicheng Yan']",,False

It is a joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA²LEN) and its Urticaria and Angioedema Centers of Reference and Excellence (UCAREs and ACAREs), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF; EuroGuiDerm), and the Asia Pacific Association of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology with the participation of 64 delegates of 50 national and international societies and from 31 countries. The consensus conference was held on 3 December 2020. This guideline was acknowledged and accepted by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS). Urticaria is a frequent, mast cell–driven disease that presents with wheals, angioedema, or both. The lifetime prevalence for acute urticaria is approximately 20%. Chronic spontaneous or inducible urticaria is disabling, impairs quality of life, and affects performance at work and school. This updated version of the international guideline for urticaria covers the definition and classification of urticaria and outlines expert‐guided and evidence‐based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the different subtypes of urticaria.",2021-09-18,2021,https://doi.org/10.1111/all.15090,986,1,1.0,"['Torsten Zuberbier', 'Amir Hamzah Abdul Latiff', 'Mohamed Abuzakouk', 'Susan Aquilina', 'Riccardo Asero', 'Diane R.

In recent years we have witnessed a dramatic shift in the genomic landscape. There has been a large increase in the number of high-quality reference genomes through global biodiversity initiatives. In parallel, there have been major advances towards pangenome representations of higher species, where many alternative genome assemblies representing different breeds, cultivars, strains and haplotypes are now available. In order to support these efforts and accelerate downstream research, it is our goal at Ensembl to create high-quality annotations, tools and services for species across the tree of life.

Although AI-based language models like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive capabilities, it is uncertain how well they will perform in real-world scenarios, particularly in fields such as medicine where high-level and complex thinking is necessary. Furthermore, while the use of ChatGPT in writing scientific articles and other scientific outputs may have potential benefits, important ethical concerns must also be addressed. Consequently, we investigated the feasibility of ChatGPT in clinical and research scenarios: (1) support of the clinical practice, (2) scientific production, (3) misuse in medicine and research, and (4) reasoning about public health topics.

This new electrophysiological recording tool is a miniaturized, high-density probe for both acute and long-term experiments combined with sophisticated software algorithms for fully automatic post hoc computational stabilization. The technique also provides a strategy for extending the number of recorded sites beyond the number of available recording channels.

American Geriatrics Society 2023 updated AGS Beers Criteria® for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults,"Abstract The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria® (AGS Beers Criteria®) for Potentially Inappropriate Medication (PIM) Use in Older Adults is widely used by clinicians, educators, researchers, healthcare administrators, and regulators. Since 2011, the AGS has been the steward of the criteria and has produced updates on a regular cycle. The AGS Beers Criteria® is an explicit list of PIMs that are typically best avoided by older adults in most circumstances or under specific situations, such as in certain diseases or conditions. For the 2023 update, an interprofessional expert panel reviewed the evidence published since the last update (2019) and based on a structured assessment process approved a number of important changes including the addition of new criteria, modification of existing criteria, and formatting changes to enhance usability. The criteria are intended to be applied to adults 65 years old and older in all ambulatory, acute, and institutionalized settings of care, except hospice and end‐of‐life care settings. Although the AGS Beers Criteria® may be used internationally, it is specifically designed for use in the United States and there may be additional considerations for certain drugs in specific countries. Whenever and wherever used, the AGS Beers Criteria® should be applied thoughtfully and in a manner that supports, rather than replaces, shared clinical decision‐making.",2023-05-04,2023,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.18372,985,-1,0.2580782781013288,['By the 2023 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria® Update Expert Panel'],,True

Simultaneous Regulation on Solvation Shell and Electrode Interface for Dendrite‐Free Zn Ion Batteries Achieved by a Low‐Cost Glucose Additive,"Abstract Dendrite growth and by‐products in Zn metal aqueous batteries have impeded their development as promising energy storage devices. We utilize a low‐cost additive, glucose, to modulate the typical ZnSO 4 electrolyte system for improving reversible plating/stripping on Zn anode for high‐performance Zn ion batteries (ZIBs). Combing experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations, we show that the glucose in ZnSO 4 aqueous environment can simultaneously modulate solvation structure of Zn 2+ and Zn anode‐electrolyte interface. The electrolyte engineering can alternate one H 2 O molecule from the primary Zn 2+ ‐6H 2 O solvation shell and restraining side reactions due to the decomposition of active water. Concomitantly, glucose molecules are inclined to absorb on the surface of Zn anode, suppressing the random growth of Zn dendrite. As a proof of concept, a symmetric cell and Zn‐MnO 2 full cell with glucose electrolyte achieve boosted stability than that with pure ZnSO 4 electrolyte.",2021-05-26,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202105756,984,4,0.5805096452545644,"['Peng Sun', 'Liang Ma', 'Wanhai Zhou', 'Meijia Qiu', 'Zilong Wang', 'Dongliang Chao', 'Wenjie Mai']",,False

Tackling the digitalization challenge: how to benefit from digitalization in practice,"Digitalization has been identified as one of the major trends changing society and business. Digitalization causes changes for companies due to the adoption of digital technologies in the organization or in the operation environment. This paper discusses digitalization from the viewpoint of diverse case studies carried out to collect data from several companies, and a literature study to complement the data. This paper describes the first version of the digital transformation model, derived from synthesis of these industrial cases, explaining a starting point for a systematic approach to tackle digital transformation. The model is aimed to help companies systematically handle the changes associated with digitalization. The model consists of four main steps, starting with positioning the company in digitalization and defining goals for the company, and then analyzing the company’s current state with respect to digitalization goals. Next, a roadmap for reaching the goals is defined and implemented in the company. These steps are iterative and can be repeated several times. Although company situations vary, these steps will help to systematically approach digitalization and to take the steps necessary to benefit from it.",2022-02-01,2022,https://doi.org/10.12821/ijispm050104,983,-1,0.22437809693876987,"['Päivi Parviainen', 'Maarit Tihinen', 'Jukka Kääriäinen', 'Susanna Teppola']",,True

A SWOT analysis of ChatGPT: Implications for educational practice and research,"ChatGPT is an AI tool that has sparked debates about its potential implications for education. We used the SWOT analysis framework to outline ChatGPT’s strengths and weaknesses and to discuss its opportunities for and threats to education. The strengths include using a sophisticated natural language model to generate plausible answers, self-improving capability, and providing personalised and real-time responses. As such, ChatGPT can increase access to information, facilitate personalised and complex learning, and decrease teaching workload, thereby making key processes and tasks more efficient. The weaknesses are a lack of deep understanding, difficulty in evaluating the quality of responses, a risk of bias and discrimination, and a lack of higher-order thinking skills. Threats to education include a lack of understanding of the context, threatening academic integrity, perpetuating discrimination in education, democratising plagiarism, and declining high-order cognitive skills.

Educational applications of metaverse: possibilities and limitations,"This review aims to define the 4 types of the metaverse and to explain the potential and limitations of its educational applications. The metaverse roadmap categorizes the metaverse into 4 types: augmented reality, lifelogging, mirror world, and virtual reality. An example of the application of augmented reality in medical education would be an augmented reality T-shirt that allows students to examine the inside of the human body as an anatomy lab. Furthermore, a research team in a hospital in Seoul developed a spinal surgery platform that applied augmented reality technology. The potential of the metaverse as a new educational environment is suggested to be as follows: a space for new social communication; a higher degree of freedom to create and share; and the provision of new experiences and high immersion through virtualization. Some of its limitations may be weaker social connections and the possibility of privacy impingement; the commission of various crimes due to the virtual space and anonymity of the metaverse; and maladaptation to the real world for students whose identity has not been established. The metaverse is predicted to change our daily life and economy beyond the realm of games and entertainment. The metaverse has infinite potential as a new social communication space. The following future tasks are suggested for the educational use of the metaverse: first, teachers should carefully analyze how students understand the metaverse; second, teachers should design classes for students to solve problems or perform projects cooperatively and creatively; third, educational metaverse platforms should be developed that prevent misuse of student data.",2021-12-12,2021,https://doi.org/10.3352/jeehp.2021.18.32,979,-1,0.17425805215970824,"['Bokyung Kye', 'Nara Han', 'Eunji Kim', 'Yeonjeong Park', 'Soyoung Jo']",,True
DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision,"The recent breakthroughs in natural language processing for model pretraining on large quantities of data have opened the way for similar foundation models in computer vision. These models could greatly simplify the use of images in any system by producing all-purpose visual features, i.e., features that work across image distributions and tasks without finetuning. This work shows that existing pretraining methods, especially self-supervised methods, can produce such features if trained on enough curated data from diverse sources. We revisit existing approaches and combine different techniques to scale our pretraining in terms of data and model size. Most of the technical contributions aim at accelerating and stabilizing the training at scale. In terms of data, we propose an automatic pipeline to build a dedicated, diverse, and curated image dataset instead of uncurated data, as typically done in the self-supervised literature. In terms of models, we train a ViT model (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) with 1B parameters and distill it into a series of smaller models that surpass the best available all-purpose features, OpenCLIP (Ilharco et al., 2021) on most of the benchmarks at image and pixel levels.",2023-04-14,2023,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2304.07193,979,0,0.5816569262188281,"['Maxime Oquab', 'Timothée Darcet', 'Théo Moutakanni', 'Huy Vo', 'Marc Szafraniec', 'Vasil Khalidov', 'Pierre Fernandez', 'Daniel Haziza', 'Francisco Massa', 'Alaaeldin El-Nouby', 'Mahmoud Assran', 'Nicolas Ballas', 'Wojciech Galuba', 'Russell Howes', 'Po-Yao Huang', 'Shang-Wen Li', 'Ishan Misra', 'Michael Rabbat', 'Vasu Sharma', 'Gabriel Synnaeve', 'Hu Xu', 'Hervé Jeǵou', 'Julien Mairal', 'Patrick Labatut', 'Armand Joulin', 'Piotr Bojanowski']",,True

Improved charge extraction in inverted perovskite solar cells with dual-site-binding ligands,"Inverted (pin) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) afford improved operating stability in comparison to their nip counterparts but have lagged in power conversion efficiency (PCE). The energetic losses responsible for this PCE deficit in pin PSCs occur primarily at the interfaces between the perovskite and the charge-transport layers. Additive and surface treatments that use passivating ligands usually bind to a single active binding site: This dense packing of electrically resistive passivants perpendicular to the surface may limit the fill factor in pin PSCs. We identified ligands that bind two neighboring lead(II) ion (Pb 2+ ) defect sites in a planar ligand orientation on the perovskite. We fabricated pin PSCs and report a certified quasi–steady state PCE of 26.15 and 24.74% for 0.05– and 1.04–square centimeter illuminated areas, respectively.

The Economics of Biodiversity : The Dasgupta Review,"We are part of Nature, not separate from it. We rely on Nature to provide us with food, water and shelter; regulate our climate and disease; maintain nutrient cycles and oxygen production; and provide us with spiritual fulfilment and opportunities for recreation and recuperation, which can enhance our health and well-being. Nature's constituents such as ecosystems and the biodiversity that are embodied in them are therefore assets. Yet Nature is more than an economic good: many recognise its intrinsic worth and argue that it has moral worth too. This landmark report explains the current state of play in relation to biodiversity loss and outlines a sustainable path to deal with this problem, one that will require us to change how we think, act and measure success.

GAPIT Version 3: Boosting Power and Accuracy for Genomic Association and Prediction,"Abstract Genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic prediction/selection (GP/GS) are the two essential enterprises in genomic research. Due to the great magnitude and complexity of genomic and phenotypic data, analytical methods and their associated software packages are frequently advanced. GAPIT is a widely-used genomic association and prediction integrated tool as an R package. The first version was released to the public in 2012 with the implementation of the general linear model (GLM), mixed linear model (MLM), compressed MLM (CMLM), and genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gBLUP). The second version was released in 2016 with several new implementations, including enriched CMLM (ECMLM) and settlement of MLMs under progressively exclusive relationship (SUPER). All the GWAS methods are based on the single-locus test. For the first time, in the current release of GAPIT, version 3 implemented three multi-locus test methods, including multiple loci mixed model (MLMM), fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU), and Bayesian-information and linkage-disequilibrium iteratively nested keyway (BLINK). Additionally, two GP/GS methods were implemented based on CMLM (named compressed BLUP; cBLUP) and SUPER (named SUPER BLUP; sBLUP). These new implementations not only boost statistical power for GWAS and prediction accuracy for GP/GS, but also improve computing speed and increase the capacity to analyze big genomic data. Here, we document the current upgrade of GAPIT by describing the selection of the recently developed methods, their implementations, and potential impact. All documents, including source code, user manual, demo data, and tutorials, are freely available at the GAPIT website (http://zzlab.net/GAPIT).",2021-08-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2021.08.005,976,-1,0.14488705148283604,"['Jiabo Wang', 'Zhiwu Zhang']",,True
Learning From Noisy Labels With Deep Neural Networks: A Survey,"Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in numerous domains with help from large amounts of big data. However, the quality of data labels is a concern because of the lack of high-quality labels in many real-world scenarios. As noisy labels severely degrade the generalization performance of deep neural networks, learning from noisy labels (robust training) is becoming an important task in modern deep learning applications. In this survey, we first describe the problem of learning with label noise from a supervised learning perspective. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of 62 state-of-the-art robust training methods, all of which are categorized into five groups according to their methodological difference, followed by a systematic comparison of six properties used to evaluate their superiority. Subsequently, we perform an in-depth analysis of noise rate estimation and summarize the typically used evaluation methodology, including public noisy datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we present several promising research directions that can serve as a guideline for future studies.",2022-03-07,2022,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2022.3152527,975,0,1.0,"['Hwanjun Song', 'Minseok Kim', 'Dongmin Park', 'Yooju Shin', 'Jae-Gil Lee']",,False

The lattice framework enables novel schemes for quantitative calculation and has caused considerable cross-disciplinary activity between elementary particle and solid state physicists. The treatment begins with the lattice definition of a path integral and ends on Monte Carlo simulation methods. Other topics include invariant group integration, duality, mean field theory and renormalization group techniques.

Dual-Dynamic-Bond Cross-Linked Antibacterial Adhesive Hydrogel Sealants with On-Demand Removability for Post-Wound-Closure and Infected Wound Healing,"The design and development of a smart bioadhesive hydrogel sealant with self-healing and excellent antibacterial activity to achieve high wound closure effectiveness and post-wound-closure care is highly desirable in clinical applications. In this work, a series of adhesive antioxidant antibacterial self-healing hydrogels with promising traits were designed through dual-dynamic-bond cross-linking among ferric iron (Fe), protocatechualdehyde (PA) containing catechol and aldehyde groups and quaternized chitosan (QCS) to enable the closure of skin incisions and promotion of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA)-infected wound healing. The dual-dynamic-bond cross-linking of a pH-sensitive coordinate bond (catechol-Fe) and dynamic Schiff base bonds with reversible breakage and re-formation equips the hydrogel with excellent autonomous healing and on-demand dissolution or removal properties. Additionally, the hydrogel presents injectability, good biocompatibility and antibacterial activity, multifunctional adhesiveness, and hemostasis as well as NIR responsiveness.

A review: Data pre-processing and data augmentation techniques,"This review paper provides an overview of data pre-processing in Machine learning, focusing on all types of problems while building the machine learning problems. It deals with two significant issues in the pre-processing process (i). issues with data and (ii). Steps to follow to do data analysis with its best approach. As raw data are vulnerable to noise, corruption, missing, and inconsistent data, it is necessary to perform pre-processing steps, which is done using classification, clustering, and association and many other pre-processing techniques available. Poor data can primarily affect the accuracy and lead to false prediction, so it is necessary to improve the dataset's quality. So, data pre-processing is the best way to deal with such problems. It makes the knowledge extraction from the data set much easier with cleaning, Integration, transformation, and reduction methods. The issue with Data missing and significant differences in the variety of data always exists as the information is collected through multiple sources and from a real-world application. So, the data augmentation approach generates data for machine learning models. To decrease the dependency on training data and to improve the performance of the machine learning model.

ConvNeXt V2: Co-designing and Scaling ConvNets with Masked Autoencoders,"Driven by improved architectures and better representation learning frameworks, the field of visual recognition has enjoyed rapid modernization and performance boost in the early 2020s. For example, modern ConvNets, represented by ConvNeXt [33], have demonstrated strong performance in various scenarios. While these models were originally designed for supervised learning with ImageNet labels, they can also potentially benefit from self-supervised learning techniques such as masked autoencoders (MAE) [14]. However, we found that simply combining these two approaches leads to subpar performance. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional masked autoencoder framework and a new Global Response Normalization (GRN) layer that can be added to the ConvNeXt architecture to enhance inter-channel feature competition. This co-design of self-supervised learning techniques and architectural improvement results in a new model family called ConvNeXt V2, which significantly improves the performance of pure ConvNets on various recognition benchmarks, including ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation. We also provide pre-trained ConvNeXt V2 models of various sizes, ranging from an efficient 3.7M-parameter Atto model with 76.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, to a 650M Huge model that achieves a state-of-the-art 88.9% accuracy using only public training data.",2023-06-01,2023,https://doi.org/10.1109/cvpr52729.2023.01548,971,0,0.5914914935859934,"['Sanghyun Woo', 'Shoubhik Debnath', 'Ronghang Hu', 'Xinlei Chen', 'Zhuang Liu', 'In So Kweon', 'Saining Xie']",,False
"Social media influencer marketing: A systematic review, integrative framework and future research agenda","Abstract Over the past few years, the popularity of social media influencers (SMIs) has been growing exponentially, making influencer marketing (IM) prevalent in firm strategies. Despite the mounting interest of researchers and practitioners, the resulting scholarly work remains divergent, partial and fragmented. In light of the pivotal role of SMIs on the consumer decision journey and as this research domain is still developing, a comprehensive and critical overview of extant research on this topic is sorely needed. In response, this paper is the first to consolidate the present state of research on IM within social media settings. More specifically, a systematic review of relevant studies published in peer‐reviewed academic journals across diverse fields was conducted in order to identify key themes and dominant concepts. The analysis of 68 articles from 29 Chartered Association of Business Schools‐ranked journals forges a robust understanding of this phenomenon, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the appeal of SMIs and their influential power in shaping consumer attitudes and behaviour. Based on the analysis, an integrative multidimensional framework is presented that considers antecedents, mediators and moderators of potential outcomes, as well as contextual factors that translate into consumer behaviour. In so doing, various research gaps are identified and avenues for future research are proposed that reflect important emerging areas and unexplored realms with reference to theory, context and methodology.

Graph Neural Network-Based Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series,"Given high-dimensional time series data (e.g., sensor data), how can we detect anomalous events, such as system faults and attacks? More challengingly, how can we do this in a way that captures complex inter-sensor relationships, and detects and explains anomalies which deviate from these relationships? Recently, deep learning approaches have enabled improvements in anomaly detection in high-dimensional datasets; however, existing methods do not explicitly learn the structure of existing relationships between variables, or use them to predict the expected behavior of time series. Our approach combines a structure learning approach with graph neural networks, additionally using attention weights to provide explainability for the detected anomalies. Experiments on two real-world sensor datasets with ground truth anomalies show that our method detects anomalies more accurately than baseline approaches, accurately captures correlations between sensors, and allows users to deduce the root cause of a detected anomaly.",2021-05-18,2021,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i5.16523,970,0,1.0,"['Ailin Deng', 'Bryan Hooi']",,True

Examining Science Education in ChatGPT: An Exploratory Study of Generative Artificial Intelligence,"Abstract The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential in the field of education. The study explores three main areas: (1) How did ChatGPT answer questions related to science education? (2) What are some ways educators could utilise ChatGPT in their science pedagogy? and (3) How has ChatGPT been utilised in this study, and what are my reflections about its use as a research tool? This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT’s output often aligned with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands, ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact, issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations. ChatGPT is likely to be a useful tool for educators designing science units, rubrics, and quizzes. Educators should critically evaluate any AI-generated resource and adapt it to their specific teaching contexts. ChatGPT was used as a research tool for assistance with editing and to experiment with making the research narrative clearer.

Prediction of Daily Climate Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model,"Climaate prediction plays a vital role in various sectors, including agriculture, disaster management, and urban planning. Traditional methods for climate forecasting often rely on complex physical models, which require substantial computational resources and may not accurately capture local weather patterns. This study explores the potential of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, for predicting daily climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity. Utilizing historical climate data from the city of Delhi, we developed an LSTM model to forecast short-term climate trends. The model consists of two LSTM layers followed by three Dense layers and is compiled with the Adam optimizer, mean squared error loss, and mean absolute error as a metric. Our results demonstrate the model's capability to capture temporal dependencies in climate data, achieving a satisfactory level of accuracy in temperature forecasting.

Pre-Training With Whole Word Masking for Chinese BERT,"Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) has shown marvelous improvements across various NLP tasks, and its consecutive variants have been proposed to further improve the performance of the pre-trained language models. In this paper, we aim to first introduce the whole word masking (wwm) strategy for Chinese BERT, along with a series of Chinese pre-trained language models. Then we also propose a simple but effective model called MacBERT, which improves upon RoBERTa in several ways. Especially, we propose a new masking strategy called MLM as correction (Mac). To demonstrate the effectiveness of these models, we create a series of Chinese pre-trained language models as our baselines, including BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, RBT, etc. We carried out extensive experiments on ten Chinese NLP tasks to evaluate the created Chinese pre-trained language models as well as the proposed MacBERT. Experimental results show that MacBERT could achieve state-of-the-art performances on many NLP tasks, and we also ablate details with several findings that may help future research.

Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,"Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents: computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty-five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors. For example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture—observation, planning, and reflection—each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior.

Determination of Antioxidants by DPPH Radical Scavenging Activity and Quantitative Phytochemical Analysis of Ficus religiosa,"The use of F. religiosa might be beneficial in inflammatory illnesses and can be used for a variety of health conditions. In this article, we studied the identification of antioxidants using (DPPH) 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazylradical scavenging activity in Ficus religiosa, as F. religiosa is an important herbal plant, and every part of it has various medicinal properties such as antibacterial properties that can be used by the researchers in the development and design of various new drugs. The 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) is a popular, quick, easy, and affordable approach for the measurement of antioxidant properties that includes the use of the free radicals used for assessing the potential of substances to serve as hydrogen providers or free-radical scavengers (FRS). The technique of DPPH testing is associated with the elimination of DPPH, which would be a stabilized free radical. The free-radical DPPH interacts with an odd electron to yield a strong absorbance at 517 nm, i.e., a purple hue. An FRS antioxidant, for example, reacts to DPPH to form DPPHH, which has a lower absorbance than DPPH because of the lower amount of hydrogen. It is radical in comparison to the DPPH-H form, because it causes decolorization, or a yellow hue, as the number of electrons absorbed increases. Decolorization affects the lowering capacity significantly. As soon as the DPPH solutions are combined with the hydrogen atom source, the lower state of diphenylpicrylhydrazine is formed, shedding its violet color. To explain the processes behind the DPPH tests, as well as their applicability to Ficus religiosa (F. religiosa) in the manufacture of metal oxide nanoparticles, in particular MgO, and their influence on antioxidants, a specimen from the test was chosen for further study. According to our findings, F. religiosa has antioxidant qualities and may be useful in the treatment of disorders caused by free radicals.",2022-02-16,2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27041326,964,-1,0.03366086237830292,"['Siddartha Baliyan', 'Riya Mukherjee', 'Anjali Priyadarshini', 'Arpana Vibhuti', 'Archana Gupta', 'Ramendra Pati Pandey', 'Chung-Ming Chang']",,True

Using Machine Learning to Identify Diseases and Perform Sorting in Apple Fruit,"Fruit diseases play a major role in global agriculture, leading to substantial crop losses and influencing food production and economic stability. In this age of Industry 4.0 the fruit sorting is an important part in the food processing wherein this work plays a vital role. In this study, a solution for the detection and classification of apple fruit diseases is proposed and experimentally validated. Deep learning models offer promise for automating disease identification using fruit images, but encounter obstacles such as therequirement for extensive training data, computational complexity, and the risk of overfitting. This study introduces an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture aimed at addressing these challenges by incorporating a reduced number of layers, thus alleviating computational burdens while maintaining performance. Additionally, augmentation techniques such as shift, shear, scaling, zoom, and flipping are employed to diversify the training set without additional image acquisition. Our CNN model is specifically trained to identify common apple crop diseases like Scab, Rot, and Blotch. Rigorous experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness ofour model, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 95.37%. Significantly, our model demonstrates reduced storage requirements and faster execution times compared to existing deep CNN architectures, enabling deployment on handheld devices and resource-limited environments. While other CNN models may offer similar accuracy levels, our approach emphasizes efficiency and resource optimization, rendering it practical for real-world applications in agriculture. Furthermore, our CNN model exhibits resilience to environmental variations and imaging parameters, enhancing its applicability across diverse agricultural settings.

Particle Image Velocimetry for MATLAB: Accuracy and enhanced algorithms in PIVlab,"PIVlab is a free toolbox and app for MATLAB®. It is used to perform Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) with image data: A light sheet illuminates particles that are suspended in a fluid. A digital camera records a series of images of the illuminated particles. The input images are divided into sub-images (interrogation areas), and for each of these, a cross-correlation is performed. The resulting correlation matrix is used to estimate the most probable displacement within each interrogation area. PIV is extensively used for flow analyses where a thin laser sheet illuminates suspended particles in the fluid, but also for other moving textures, like cell migration or ultrasonic images. This paper presents several improvements that were implemented in PIVlab, enhancing the robustness of displacement estimates. The benefit of these improvements is evaluated using experimental images and synthetic images of particle and non-particle textures. Linear correlation and repeated correlation increase the robustness and decrease bias and root-mean-square (RMS) error of the displacement estimates. Particle images have a significantly lower bias and RMS error than non-particle images.",2021-05-31,2021,https://doi.org/10.5334/jors.334,960,0,0.6388292395538518,"['William Thielicke', 'René Sonntag']",,True
YOLOv10: Real-Time End-to-End Object Detection,"Over the past years, YOLOs have emerged as the predominant paradigm in the field of real-time object detection owing to their effective balance between computational cost and detection performance. Researchers have explored the architectural designs, optimization objectives, data augmentation strategies, and others for YOLOs, achieving notable progress. However, the reliance on the non-maximum suppression (NMS) for post-processing hampers the end-to-end deployment of YOLOs and adversely impacts the inference latency. Besides, the design of various components in YOLOs lacks the comprehensive and thorough inspection, resulting in noticeable computational redundancy and limiting the model's capability. It renders the suboptimal efficiency, along with considerable potential for performance improvements. In this work, we aim to further advance the performance-efficiency boundary of YOLOs from both the post-processing and model architecture. To this end, we first present the consistent dual assignments for NMS-free training of YOLOs, which brings competitive performance and low inference latency simultaneously. Moreover, we introduce the holistic efficiency-accuracy driven model design strategy for YOLOs. We comprehensively optimize various components of YOLOs from both efficiency and accuracy perspectives, which greatly reduces the computational overhead and enhances the capability. The outcome of our effort is a new generation of YOLO series for real-time end-to-end object detection, dubbed YOLOv10. Extensive experiments show that YOLOv10 achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across various model scales. For example, our YOLOv10-S is 1.8$\times$ faster than RT-DETR-R18 under the similar AP on COCO, meanwhile enjoying 2.8$\times$ smaller number of parameters and FLOPs. Compared with YOLOv9-C, YOLOv10-B has 46\% less latency and 25\% fewer parameters for the same performance.",2024-05-23,2024,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2405.14458,960,0,1.0,"['Ao Wang', 'Hui Chen', 'Lihao Liu', 'Kai Chen', 'Zijia Lin', 'Jungong Han', 'Guiguang Ding']",,True

Research on the Impact of Geopolitical Instability on Russian Trade,"This study examines how global and country- specific geopolitical instability affects Russian trade using data from 1996 to 2021. A panel regression model analyzes trade between Russia and its 15 top trading partners, exploring both direct and indirect effects. The analysis focuses on how accumulated foreign direct investment (FDI) and exchange rate fluctuations mediate these relationships. The findings reveal that global geopolitical instability decrease Russian trade by 0.0558. Interestingly, this negative impact is partially mediated by a decrease in FDI (-0.0805). This aligns with the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results, which show a significant negative effect of global geopolitical instability on FDI (-1.209). This suggests that FDI acts as a key transmitter of the negative effects of global instability on Russian trade. The role of exchange rate fluctuations, however, is more complex. While the Sobel Test indicated a negative indirect effect, the SEM analysis shows a positive indirect effect through exchange rate fluctuations on trade. This suggests potentially countervailing effects of currency fluctuations, with depreciation potentially incentivizing exports while appreciation might make imports cheaper. The impact of country-specific geopolitical instability varies depending on the context. Industries like food products and textiles are significantly affected by geopolitical instability increase, while sectors such as fuels, metals and raw materials show resilience. Close trading partners are less affected by global instability but suffer from partner- specific instability. Geographically, Western Europe benefits from global instability but faces challenges from partner-specific instability, contrasting with Eastern Europe and Asia. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of how geopolitical instability, mediated by FDI and exchange rates, shapes Russia's trade performance.",2024-08-03,2024,https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24jul1500,959,2,0.5444022852646215,['Pavel Talamanov'],,True

Investigating Non-Newtonian Fluid Behavior in Hydrocyclones Via Computational Fluid Dynamics,"Expert researchers examine complex patterns of pressure, viscosity, and velocity in a CFD study of viscoelastic food inside hydrocyclones to obtain a detailed grasp of particle behavior and fluid dynamics. Velocity profiles show how fluids and particles flow through the hydrocyclone in complex ways, while pressure distributions show where high and low pressure is found, regions that are critical for maximizing separation efficiency. Furthermore, the analysis of viscosity fluctuations clarifies the intricate relationship between fluid rheology and flow dynamics, providing information on how food's viscoelastic characteristics affect particle trajectories and separation efficiency. Utilizing this comprehensive examination, scientists hope to optimize the design and functioning parameters of the hydrocyclones, which will in turn improve the efficacy and efficiency of particle separation procedures in viscoelastic food solutions. This will ultimately lead to improvements in food processing technology and product quality. Researchers look into the impact of geometric elements on flow patterns and separation efficiency in addition to these characteristics, such as hydrocyclone size and inlet configurations. Additionally, they investigate how different operating parameters, such rotational speed and flow rate, affect how well the hydrocyclone handles viscoelastic food items. Through the integration of these complex analyses, researchers hope to create all encompassing models that can precisely forecast and optimize the behavior of viscoelastic food flows inside hydrocyclones, opening the door to improved process control and food sector product quality.",2024-05-10,2024,https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24apr2380,958,0,0.33726092413740516,"['Raj Shekhar', 'Abir Chakravorty']",,True

A Systematic Review on the Distribution of Invasive Plant Species Across Asia: Assessing the Rates of Invasion Success and Management,"The advancement of invasive plant species in a particular environment is threatening across Asia. When they are introduced, they could have a variety of different negative effects, either as minor inconveniences or a severe problem. The aim of this review is to compile a list of invasive plant species across Asia and organize a set of data according to their reproduction rates, growth rates, dispersal rates, and characterize the allelochemicals they produce and allelopathic effects they have on their environment. The target is to know the extent of their spread ability in the area that they inhibit and know what control measures can be done with that specific species. The data has been gathered by compiling research articles and obtaining pertinent data relating to the objective. This review also utilized the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist to confirm the credibility of the collected references. To achieve the needed references, keywords such as ""distribution"", ""invasive"", and ""Asia"" have been used to search for these on search engines and research journals such as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, and Directory for Open Access Journals, to be then compiled in spreadsheets and document files. The results show that the growth rate of these species varies from 7.5-60 cm per year, where Ipomoea eberhardtii has the highest growth rate of 60 cm per year. The dispersal rates of the species ranges from 0.002-2592 km from the parent plant, where animal mediated, water, and wind dispersal methods are the primary vector to spread. Allelopathic effects produced by the allelochemicals present mostly inhibit growth and seed germination. There are already implemented approaches to control these species, where biological control, physical means, and the use of chemicals are the most used strategies.

"Cancer incidence, mortality, and burden in China: a time‐trend analysis and comparison with the United States and United Kingdom based on the global epidemiological data released in 2020","Abstract Background Cancer is one of the leading causes of death and a main economic burden in China. Investigating the differences in cancer patterns and control strategies between China and developed countries could provide reference for policy planning and contribute to improving cancer control measures. In this study, we reviewed the rates and trends of cancer incidence and mortality and disability‐adjusted life year (DALY) burden in China, and compared them with those in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Methods Cancer incidence, mortality, and DALY data for China, US and UK were obtained from the GLOBOCAN 2020 online database, Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study, and Cancer Incidence in Five Continents plus database (CI5 plus). Trends of cancer incidence and mortality in China, US, and UK were analyzed using Joinpoint regression models to calculate annual percent changes (APCs) and identify the best‐fitting joinpoints. Results An estimated 4,568,754 newly diagnosed cancer cases and 3,002,899 cancer deaths occurred in China in 2020. Additionally, cancers resulted in 67,340,309 DALYs in China. Compared to the US and UK, China had lower cancer incidence but higher cancer mortality and DALY rates. Furthermore, the cancer spectrum of China was changing, with a rapid increase incidence and burden of lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer in addition to a high incidence and heavy burden of liver, stomach, esophageal, and cervical cancer. Conclusions The cancer spectrum of China is changing from a developing country to a developed country. Population aging and increase of unhealthy lifestyles would continue to increase the cancer burden of China. Therefore, the Chinese authorities should adjust the national cancer control program with reference to the practices of cancer control which have been well‐established in the developed countries, and taking consideration of the diversity of cancer types by of different regions in China at the same time.",2021-07-20,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/cac2.12197,958,3,1.0,"['Haibo Qiu', 'Su‐Mei Cao', 'Rui‐Hua Xu']",,True
Advanced Modelling of Soil Organic Carbon Content in Coal Mining Areas Using Integrated Spectral Analysis: A Dengcao Coal Mine Case Study,"Effective modelling and integrated spectral analysis approaches can advance modelling precision. To develop an integrated spectral forecast modelling of soil organic carbon (SOC), this research investigated a mining coal in Dengcao Coal Mine Area, Zhengzhou. The study utilizes the Lasso and Ranger algorithms were utilized in spectral band analysis. Four primary models employed during this process include Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine, Random Forest (RF), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). The ideal model was chosen. The results showed that, in contrast to when band collection was based on Lasso algorithm modelling, model precision was higher when it was based on the Ranger algorithm. ANN model had an ideal goodness acceptance, and the modelling developed by RF showed the steadiest modelling consequences. Based on the results, a distinct method is proposed in this study for band assortment at the earlier stage of integrated spectral modelling of SOC. The Ranger method can be used to check the spectral particles, and RF or ANN can be chosen to develop the prediction modelling based on different statistics sets, which is appropriate to create the prediction modelling of SOC content in Dengcao Coal Mine Area. This research avails a position for the integrated spectral of Analysis for Advanced Modelling of Soil Organic Carbon Content in Coal Sources alongside a theoretical foundation for innovating portable device for the integrated spectral assessment of SOC content in coal mining habitats.

By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples. Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures.

Usability of Symbolic Regression for Hybrid System Identification - System Classes and Parameters (Short Paper),"Hybrid systems, which combine both continuous and discrete behavior, are used in many fields, including robotics, biological systems, and control systems. However, due to their complexity, finding an accurate model is a challenge. This paper discusses the usage of symbolic regression to learn hybrid systems from data and specifically analyses learning parameters for a recent algorithm. Symbolic regression is a powerful tool that can automatically discover accurate and interpretable mathematical models in the form of symbolic expressions. Models generated by symbolic regression are a valuable tool for system identification and diagnosis, e.g., to predict future system behavior or detect anomalies. A major opportunity of our approach is the ability to detect transitions between different continuous behaviors of a system directly based on the dynamics. From a diagnosis perspective, this can advantageously be used to detect the system entering fault modes and identify their models. This paper presents a parameter study for a symbolic regression based identification algorithm.",2024-01-01,2024,https://doi.org/10.4230/oasics.dx.2024.30,957,0,0.3018982129346909,"['Takuya Akiba', 'Shotaro Sano', 'Toshihiko Yanase', 'Takeru Ohta', 'Masanori Koyama']",,True
Five-Year Outcomes With Pembrolizumab Versus Chemotherapy for Metastatic Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer With PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score ≥ 50%,"PURPOSE We report the first 5-year follow-up of any first-line phase III immunotherapy trial for non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KEYNOTE-024 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02142738 ) is an open-label, randomized controlled trial of pembrolizumab compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated NSCLC with a programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score of at least 50% and no sensitizing EGFR or ALK alterations. Previous analyses showed pembrolizumab significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). METHODS Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to pembrolizumab (200 mg once every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles) or platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients in the chemotherapy group with progressive disease could cross over to pembrolizumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival; OS was a secondary end point. RESULTS Three hundred five patients were randomly assigned: 154 to pembrolizumab and 151 to chemotherapy. Median (range) time from randomization to data cutoff (June 1, 2020) was 59.9 (55.1-68.4) months. Among patients initially assigned to chemotherapy, 99 received subsequent anti–PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy, representing a 66.0% effective crossover rate. Median OS was 26.3 months (95% CI, 18.3 to 40.4) for pembrolizumab and 13.4 months (9.4-18.3) for chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.81). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 5-year OS rate were 31.9% for the pembrolizumab group and 16.3% for the chemotherapy group. Thirty-nine patients received 35 cycles (ie, approximately 2 years) of pembrolizumab, 82.1% of whom were still alive at data cutoff (approximately 5 years). Toxicity did not increase with longer treatment exposure. CONCLUSION Pembrolizumab provides a durable, clinically meaningful long-term OS benefit versus chemotherapy as first-line therapy for metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 tumor proportion score of at least 50%.",2021-04-19,2021,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.21.00174,957,3,0.577437407166724,"['Martin Reck', 'Delvys Rodríguez‐Abreu', 'Andrew Robinson', 'Rina Hui', 'Tibor Csőszi', 'Andrea Fülöp', 'Maya Gottfried', 'Nir Peled', 'Ali Tafreshi', 'Sinéad Cuffe', 'Mary O’Brien', 'Suman Rao', 'Katsuyuki Hotta', 'Ticiana Leal', 'Jonathan W.

"High-entropy ceramics: Present status, challenges, and a look forward","Abstract High-entropy ceramics (HECs) are solid solutions of inorganic compounds with one or more Wyckoff sites shared by equal or near-equal atomic ratios of multi-principal elements. Although in the infant stage, the emerging of this new family of materials has brought new opportunities for material design and property tailoring. Distinct from metals, the diversity in crystal structure and electronic structure of ceramics provides huge space for properties tuning through band structure engineering and phonon engineering. Aside from strengthening, hardening, and low thermal conductivity that have already been found in high-entropy alloys, new properties like colossal dielectric constant, super ionic conductivity, severe anisotropic thermal expansion coefficient, strong electromagnetic wave absorption, etc., have been discovered in HECs. As a response to the rapid development in this nascent field, this article gives a comprehensive review on the structure features, theoretical methods for stability and property prediction, processing routes, novel properties, and prospective applications of HECs. The challenges on processing, characterization, and property predictions are also emphasized.

TotalSegmentator: Robust Segmentation of 104 Anatomic Structures in CT Images,"Purpose To present a deep learning segmentation model that can automatically and robustly segment all major anatomic structures on body CT images. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 1204 CT examinations (from 2012, 2016, and 2020) were used to segment 104 anatomic structures (27 organs, 59 bones, 10 muscles, and eight vessels) relevant for use cases such as organ volumetry, disease characterization, and surgical or radiation therapy planning. The CT images were randomly sampled from routine clinical studies and thus represent a real-world dataset (different ages, abnormalities, scanners, body parts, sequences, and sites). The authors trained an nnU-Net segmentation algorithm on this dataset and calculated Dice similarity coefficients to evaluate the model’s performance. The trained algorithm was applied to a second dataset of 4004 whole-body CT examinations to investigate age-dependent volume and attenuation changes. Results The proposed model showed a high Dice score (0.943) on the test set, which included a wide range of clinical data with major abnormalities. The model significantly outperformed another publicly available segmentation model on a separate dataset (Dice score, 0.932 vs 0.871; P < .001). The aging study demonstrated significant correlations between age and volume and mean attenuation for a variety of organ groups (eg, age and aortic volume [rs = 0.64; P < .001]; age and mean attenuation of the autochthonous dorsal musculature [rs = −0.74; P < .001]).

DNABERT: pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model for DNA-language in genome,"Abstract Motivation Deciphering the language of non-coding DNA is one of the fundamental problems in genome research. Gene regulatory code is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios. Results To address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation, named DNABERT, to capture global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use, accuracy and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites and transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using small task-specific labeled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic relationship within input sequences for better interpretability and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily applied to other organisms with exceptional performance.

Educational Leadership,"Leadership is a field studied considerably since ancient years. Leadership scholars concentrate on the innate traits that born leaders have, while others focus on the traits attained throughout a person's life. Another common notion is that mainly individuals in higher positions in organizations practice leadership. Although students of leadership mainly study it during their university years, the plethora of leadership educational programs often teach on a theoretical basis leading to partial application to real-world cases. Recent research has surfaced the need to enrich primary and secondary education and curricula with instructional methodologies, which instill leadership qualities to students, like ethos, empathy, and compassion, while providing students with skills and capabilities essential to develop effective leaders of tomorrow. Additionally, educating young students to become accountable, compassionate, and kind while enriching their learning with service mindedness and the cultivation of belonging, collaboration, and interaction builds character and leadership qualities.",2021-03-05,2021,https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-7998-7760-8.ch009,953,-1,0.5750325862881591,['Jenny E.

Searching for the Nano-Hertz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background with the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array Data Release I,"Abstract Observing and timing a group of millisecond pulsars with high rotational stability enables the direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs). The GW signals can be identified from the spatial correlations encoded in the times-of-arrival of widely spaced pulsar-pairs.

Graph Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Augmentation,"Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a successful method for unsupervised graph representation learning. Most graph CL methods first perform stochastic augmentation on the input graph to obtain two graph views and maximize the agreement of representations in the two views. Despite the prosperous development of graph CL methods, the design of graph augmentation schemes -- a crucial component in CL -- remains rarely explored. We argue that the data augmentation schemes should preserve intrinsic structures and attributes of graphs, which will force the model to learn representations that are insensitive to perturbation on unimportant nodes and edges. However, most existing methods adopt uniform data augmentation schemes, like uniformly dropping edges and uniformly shuffling features, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel graph contrastive representation learning method with adaptive augmentation that incorporates various priors for topological and semantic aspects of the graph. Specifically, on the topology level, we design augmentation schemes based on node centrality measures to highlight important connective structures. On the node attribute level, we corrupt node features by adding more noise to unimportant node features, to enforce the model to recognize underlying semantic information. We perform extensive experiments of node classification on a variety of real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines and even surpasses some supervised counterparts, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed contrastive framework with adaptive augmentation.",2021-04-19,2021,https://doi.org/10.1145/3442381.3449802,952,0,0.7240160907010007,"['Yanqiao Zhu', 'Yichen Xu', 'Feng Yu', 'Qiang Liu', 'Shu Wu', 'Liang Wang']",,True

The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on child and adolescent mental health: systematic review,"Abstract COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, resulting in many countries worldwide calling for lockdowns. This study aimed to review the existing literature on the effects of the lockdown measures established as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents. Embase, Ovid, Global Health, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and pre-print databases were searched in this PRISMA-compliant systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42021225604). We included individual studies reporting on a wide range of mental health outcomes, including risk and protective factors, conducted in children and adolescents (aged ≤ 19 years), exposed to COVID-19 lockdown. Data extraction and quality appraisal were conducted by independent researchers, and results were synthesised by core themes. 61 articles with 54,999 children and adolescents were included (mean age = 11.3 years, 49.7% female). Anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms were common in the included studies and ranged 1.8–49.5% and 2.2–63.8%, respectively. Irritability (range = 16.7–73.2%) and anger (range = 30.0–51.3%), were also frequently reported by children and adolescents. Special needs and the presence of mental disorders before the lockdown, alongside excessive media exposure, were significant risk factors for anxiety. Parent–child communication was protective for anxiety and depression. The COVID-19 lockdown has resulted in psychological distress and highlighted vulnerable groups such as those with previous or current mental health difficulties. Supporting the mental health needs of children and adolescents at risk is key. Clinical guidelines to alleviate the negative effects of COVID-19 lockdown and public health strategies to support this population need to be developed.",2021-08-18,2021,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01856-w,951,1,1.0,"['Urvashi Panchal', 'Gonzalo Salazar de Pablo', 'Macarena Franco', 'Carmen Moreno', 'Mara Parellada', 'Celso Arango', 'Paolo Fusar‐Poli']",,True
Cardiovascular and kidney outcomes with finerenone in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: the FIDELITY pooled analysis,"Abstract Aims The complementary studies FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) examined cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in different, overlapping stages of CKD. The purpose of the FIDELITY analysis was to perform an individual patient-level prespecified pooled efficacy and safety analysis across a broad spectrum of CKD to provide more robust estimates of safety and efficacy of finerenone compared with placebo. Methods and results For this prespecified analysis, two phase III, multicentre, double-blind trials involving patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes, randomized 1:1 to finerenone or placebo, were combined. Main time-to-event efficacy outcomes were a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure, and a composite of kidney failure, a sustained ≥57% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline over ≥4 weeks, or renal death. Among 13 026 patients with a median follow-up of 3.0 years (interquartile range 2.3–3.8 years), the composite cardiovascular outcome occurred in 825 (12.7%) patients receiving finerenone and 939 (14.4%) receiving placebo [hazard ratio (HR), 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78–0.95; P = 0.0018]. The composite kidney outcome occurred in 360 (5.5%) patients receiving finerenone and 465 (7.1%) receiving placebo (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.88; P = 0.0002). Overall safety outcomes were generally similar between treatment arms. Hyperkalaemia leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred more frequently in patients receiving finerenone (1.7%) than placebo (0.6%). Conclusion Finerenone reduced the risk of clinically important cardiovascular and kidney outcomes vs. placebo across the spectrum of CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes. Key Question Does finerenone, a novel selective, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, added to maximum tolerated renin–angiotensin system inhibition reduce cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression over a broad range of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes? Key Finding In a prespecified, pooled individual-level analysis from two randomized trials, we found reductions both in cardiovascular events and kidney failure outcomes with finerenone. Because 40% of the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of &amp;gt;60 mL/min/1.73m2 they were identified solely on the basis of albuminuria. Take Home Message Finerenone reduces the risk of clinical cardiovascular outcomes and kidney disease progression in a broad range of patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. Screening for albuminuria to identify at-risk patients among patients with type 2 diabetes facilitates reduction of both cardiovascular and kidney disease burden.",2021-11-01,2021,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab777,950,1,0.35325144485584226,"['Rajiv Agarwal', 'Gerasimos Filippatos', 'Bertram Pitt', 'Stefan D.

Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Cross Pseudo Supervision,"In this paper, we study the semi-supervised semantic segmentation problem via exploring both labeled data and extra unlabeled data. We propose a novel consistency regularization approach, called cross pseudo supervision (CPS). Our approach imposes the consistency on two segmentation networks perturbed with different initialization for the same input image. The pseudo one-hot label map, output from one perturbed segmentation network, is used to supervise the other segmentation network with the standard cross-entropy loss, and vice versa. The CPS consistency has two roles: encourage high similarity between the predictions of two perturbed networks for the same input image, and expand training data by using the unlabeled data with pseudo labels.

Diabetic Foot Ulcers,"Importance Approximately 18.6 million people worldwide are affected by a diabetic foot ulcer each year, including 1.6 million people in the United States. These ulcers precede 80% of lower extremity amputations among people diagnosed with diabetes and are associated with an increased risk of death. Observations Neurological, vascular, and biomechanical factors contribute to diabetic foot ulceration. Approximately 50% to 60% of ulcers become infected, and about 20% of moderate to severe infections lead to lower extremity amputations. The 5-year mortality rate for individuals with a diabetic foot ulcer is approximately 30%, exceeding 70% for those with a major amputation. The mortality rate for people with diabetic foot ulcers is 231 deaths per 1000 person-years, compared with 182 deaths per 1000 person-years in people with diabetes without foot ulcers. People who are Black, Hispanic, or Native American and people with low socioeconomic status have higher rates of diabetic foot ulcer and subsequent amputation compared with White people. Classifying ulcers based on the degree of tissue loss, ischemia, and infection can help identify risk of limb-threatening disease. Several interventions reduce risk of ulcers compared with usual care, such as pressure-relieving footwear (13.3% vs 25.4%; relative risk, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28-0.84), foot skin measurements with off-loading when hot spots (ie, greater than 2 °C difference between the affected foot and the unaffected foot) are found (18.7% vs 30.8%; relative risk, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31-0.84), and treatment of preulcer signs. Surgical debridement, reducing pressure from weight bearing on the ulcer, and treating lower extremity ischemia and foot infection are first-line therapies for diabetic foot ulcers. Randomized clinical trials support treatments to accelerate wound healing and culture-directed oral antibiotics for localized osteomyelitis. Multidisciplinary care, typically consisting of podiatrists, infectious disease specialists, and vascular surgeons, in close collaboration with primary care clinicians, is associated with lower major amputation rates relative to usual care (3.2% vs 4.4%; odds ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.32-0.51). Approximately 30% to 40% of diabetic foot ulcers heal at 12 weeks, and recurrence after healing is estimated to be 42% at 1 year and 65% at 5 years. Conclusions and Relevance Diabetic foot ulcers affect approximately 18.6 million people worldwide each year and are associated with increased rates of amputation and death.

miRTarBase update 2022: an informative resource for experimentally validated miRNA–target interactions,"Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs with 18–26 nucleotides; they pair with target mRNAs to regulate gene expression and produce significant changes in various physiological and pathological processes. In recent years, the interaction between miRNAs and their target genes has become one of the mainstream directions for drug development. As a large-scale biological database that mainly provides miRNA–target interactions (MTIs) verified by biological experiments, miRTarBase has undergone five revisions and enhancements. The database has accumulated &amp;gt;2 200 449 verified MTIs from 13 389 manually curated articles and CLIP-seq data. An optimized scoring system is adopted to enhance this update’s critical recognition of MTI-related articles and corresponding disease information. In addition, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and disease-related variants related to the binding efficiency of miRNA and target were characterized in miRNAs and gene 3′ untranslated regions. miRNA expression profiles across extracellular vesicles, blood and different tissues, including exosomal miRNAs and tissue-specific miRNAs, were integrated to explore miRNA functions and biomarkers. For the user interface, we have classified attributes, including RNA expression, specific interaction, protein expression and biological function, for various validation experiments related to the role of miRNA. We also used seed sequence information to evaluate the binding sites of miRNA. In summary, these enhancements render miRTarBase as one of the most research-amicable MTI databases that contain comprehensive and experimentally verified annotations.

Microglia in neurodegenerative diseases: mechanism and potential therapeutic targets,"Abstract Microglia activation is observed in various neurodegenerative diseases. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have revealed that these reactive microglia were with high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Some identified microglia in specific states correlate with pathological hallmarks and are associated with specific functions. Microglia both exert protective function by phagocytosing and clearing pathological protein aggregates and play detrimental roles due to excessive uptake of protein aggregates, which would lead to microglial phagocytic ability impairment, neuroinflammation, and eventually neurodegeneration. In addition, peripheral immune cells infiltration shapes microglia into a pro-inflammatory phenotype and accelerates disease progression. Microglia also act as a mobile vehicle to propagate protein aggregates. Extracellular vesicles released from microglia and autophagy impairment in microglia all contribute to pathological progression and neurodegeneration. Thus, enhancing microglial phagocytosis, reducing microglial-mediated neuroinflammation, inhibiting microglial exosome synthesis and secretion, and promoting microglial conversion into a protective phenotype are considered to be promising strategies for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we comprehensively review the biology of microglia and the roles of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies and Huntington’s disease. We also summarize the possible microglia-targeted interventions and treatments against neurodegenerative diseases with preclinical and clinical evidence in cell experiments, animal studies, and clinical trials.",2023-09-22,2023,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01588-0,949,3,0.41832164577134145,"['Chao Gao', 'Jingwen Jiang', 'Yuyan Tan', 'Shengdi Chen']",,True
Artificial intelligence in education: Addressing ethical challenges in K-12 settings,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of study that combines the applications of machine learning, algorithm productions, and natural language processing. Applications of AI transform the tools of education. AI has a variety of educational applications, such as personalized learning platforms to promote students' learning, automated assessment systems to aid teachers, and facial recognition systems to generate insights about learners' behaviors. Despite the potential benefits of AI to support students' learning experiences and teachers' practices, the ethical and societal drawbacks of these systems are rarely fully considered in K-12 educational contexts. The ethical challenges of AI in education must be identified and introduced to teachers and students. To address these issues, this paper (1) briefly defines AI through the concepts of machine learning and algorithms; (2) introduces applications of AI in educational settings and benefits of AI systems to support students' learning processes; (3) describes ethical challenges and dilemmas of using AI in education; and (4) addresses the teaching and understanding of AI by providing recommended instructional resources from two providers-i.e., the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Media Lab and Code.org.

Unified language model pre-training for natural language understanding and generation,"This paper presents a new Unified pre-trained Language Model (UniLM) that can be fine-tuned for both natural language understanding and generation tasks. The model is pre-trained using three types of language modeling tasks: unidirectional, bidirectional, and sequence-to-sequence prediction. The unified modeling is achieved by employing a shared Transformer network and utilizing specific self-attention masks to control what context the prediction conditions on. UniLM compares favorably with BERT on the GLUE benchmark, and the SQuAD 2.0 and CoQA question answering tasks. Moreover, UniLM achieves new state-of-the-art results on five natural language generation datasets, including improving the CNN/DailyMail abstractive summarization ROUGE-L to 40.51 (2.04 absolute improvement), the Gigaword abstractive summarization ROUGE-L to 35.75 (0.86 absolute improvement), the CoQA generative question answering F1 score to 82.5 (37.1 absolute improvement), the SQuAD question generation BLEU-4 to 22.12 (3.75 absolute improvement), and the DSTC7 document-grounded dialog response generation NIST-4 to 2.67 (human performance is 2.65).

You Are What You Tweet: Analyzing Twitter for Public Health,"Analyzing user messages in social media can measure different population characteristics, including public health measures. For example, recent work has correlated Twitter messages with influenza rates in the United States; but this has largely been the extent of mining Twitter for public health. In this work, we consider a broader range of public health applications for Twitter. We apply the recently introduced Ailment Topic Aspect Model to over one and a half million health related tweets and discover mentions of over a dozen ailments, including allergies, obesity and insomnia. We introduce extensions to incorporate prior knowledge into this model and apply it to several tasks: tracking illnesses over times (syndromic surveillance), measuring behavioral risk factors, localizing illnesses by geographic region, and analyzing symptoms and medication usage. We show quantitative correlations with public health data and qualitative evaluations of model output.

Generalizing hierarchical and variation partitioning in multiple regression and canonical analyses using the rdacca.hp R package,"Abstract Canonical analysis, a generalization of multiple regression to multiple‐response variables, is widely used in ecology. Because these models often involve many parameters (one slope per response per predictor), they pose challenges to model interpretation. Among these challenges, we lack quantitative frameworks for estimating the overall importance of single predictors in multi‐response regression models. Here we demonstrate that commonality analysis and hierarchical partitioning, widely used for both estimating predictor importance and improving the interpretation of single‐response regression models, are related and complementary frameworks that can be expanded for the analysis of multiple‐response models. In this application, we (a) demonstrate the mathematical links between commonality analysis, variation and hierarchical partitioning; (b) generalize these frameworks to allow the analysis of any number of predictor variables or groups of predictor variables as in the case of variation partitioning; and (c) introduce and demonstrate the implementation of these generalized frameworks in the R package rdacca.hp .",2022-01-12,2022,https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.13800,946,2,0.4415892449313066,"['Jiangshan Lai', 'Yi Zou', 'Jinlong Zhang', 'Pedro R.

Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma,"Large B-cell lymphomas, with an estimated 150,000 new cases annually worldwide, represent almost 30% of all cases of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Patients typically present with progressive lymphadenopathy, extranodal disease, or both and require therapy. Despite the advanced stage at presentation in the majority of patients, more than 60% can be cured with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) immunochemotherapy (Fig. 1A). Patients with treatment failure after R-CHOP often have a poor outcome — in particular, those with disease that is refractory to frontline or subsequent therapies — although some patients can have a durable remission and be cured after secondary therapies.

Barriers to and Facilitators of User Engagement With Digital Mental Health Interventions: Systematic Review,"Background Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), which deliver mental health support via technologies such as mobile apps, can increase access to mental health support, and many studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving symptoms. However, user engagement varies, with regard to a user’s uptake and sustained interactions with these interventions. Objective This systematic review aims to identify common barriers and facilitators that influence user engagement with DMHIs. Methods A systematic search was conducted in the SCOPUS, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Empirical studies that report qualitative and/or quantitative data were included. Results A total of 208 articles met the inclusion criteria. The included articles used a variety of methodologies, including interviews, surveys, focus groups, workshops, field studies, and analysis of user reviews. Factors extracted for coding were related to the end user, the program or content offered by the intervention, and the technology and implementation environment. Common barriers included severe mental health issues that hampered engagement, technical issues, and a lack of personalization. Common facilitators were social connectedness facilitated by the intervention, increased insight into health, and a feeling of being in control of one’s own health. Conclusions Although previous research suggests that DMHIs can be useful in supporting mental health, contextual factors are important determinants of whether users actually engage with these interventions. The factors identified in this review can provide guidance when evaluating DMHIs to help explain and understand user engagement and can inform the design and development of new digital interventions.",2021-02-08,2021,https://doi.org/10.2196/24387,945,-1,0.2951742684852983,"['Judith Borghouts', 'Elizabeth V.

"Incidence, co-occurrence, and evolution of long-COVID features: A 6-month retrospective cohort study of 273,618 survivors of COVID-19","Background Long-COVID refers to a variety of symptoms affecting different organs reported by people following Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. To date, there have been no robust estimates of the incidence and co-occurrence of long-COVID features, their relationship to age, sex, or severity of infection, and the extent to which they are specific to COVID-19. The aim of this study is to address these issues. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on linked electronic health records (EHRs) data from 81 million patients including 273,618 COVID-19 survivors. The incidence and co-occurrence within 6 months and in the 3 to 6 months after COVID-19 diagnosis were calculated for 9 core features of long-COVID (breathing difficulties/breathlessness, fatigue/malaise, chest/throat pain, headache, abdominal symptoms, myalgia, other pain, cognitive symptoms, and anxiety/depression). Their co-occurrence network was also analyzed. Comparison with a propensity score–matched cohort of patients diagnosed with influenza during the same time period was achieved using Kaplan–Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model. The incidence of atopic dermatitis was used as a negative control. Among COVID-19 survivors (mean [SD] age: 46.3 [19.8], 55.6% female), 57.00% had one or more long-COVID feature recorded during the whole 6-month period (i.e., including the acute phase), and 36.55% between 3 and 6 months. The incidence of each feature was: abnormal breathing (18.71% in the 1- to 180-day period; 7.94% in the 90- to180-day period), fatigue/malaise (12.82%; 5.87%), chest/throat pain (12.60%; 5.71%), headache (8.67%; 4.63%), other pain (11.60%; 7.19%), abdominal symptoms (15.58%; 8.29%), myalgia (3.24%; 1.54%), cognitive symptoms (7.88%; 3.95%), and anxiety/depression (22.82%; 15.49%). All 9 features were more frequently reported after COVID-19 than after influenza (with an overall excess incidence of 16.60% and hazard ratios between 1.44 and 2.04, all p &lt; 0.001), co-occurred more commonly, and formed a more interconnected network. Significant differences in incidence and co-occurrence were associated with sex, age, and illness severity. Besides the limitations inherent to EHR data, limitations of this study include that (i) the findings do not generalize to patients who have had COVID-19 but were not diagnosed, nor to patients who do not seek or receive medical attention when experiencing symptoms of long-COVID; (ii) the findings say nothing about the persistence of the clinical features; and (iii) the difference between cohorts might be affected by one cohort seeking or receiving more medical attention for their symptoms. Conclusions Long-COVID clinical features occurred and co-occurred frequently and showed some specificity to COVID-19, though they were also observed after influenza. Different long-COVID clinical profiles were observed based on demographics and illness severity.",2021-09-28,2021,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003773,945,1,1.0,"['Maxime Taquet', 'Quentin Dercon', 'Sierra Luciano', 'John Geddes', 'Masud Husain', 'Paul J.

Soft Materials by Design: Unconventional Polymer Networks Give Extreme Properties,"Hydrogels are polymer networks infiltrated with water. Many biological hydrogels in animal bodies such as muscles, heart valves, cartilages, and tendons possess extreme mechanical properties including being extremely tough, strong, resilient, adhesive, and fatigue-resistant. These mechanical properties are also critical for hydrogels' diverse applications ranging from drug delivery, tissue engineering, medical implants, wound dressings, and contact lenses to sensors, actuators, electronic devices, optical devices, batteries, water harvesters, and soft robots. Whereas numerous hydrogels have been developed over the last few decades, a set of general principles that can rationally guide the design of hydrogels using different materials and fabrication methods for various applications remain a central need in the field of soft materials. This review is aimed at synergistically reporting: (i) general design principles for hydrogels to achieve extreme mechanical and physical properties, (ii) implementation strategies for the design principles using <i>unconventional polymer networks</i>, and (iii) future directions for the orthogonal design of hydrogels to achieve multiple combined mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological properties. Because these design principles and implementation strategies are based on generic polymer networks, they are also applicable to other soft materials including elastomers and organogels. Overall, the review will not only provide comprehensive and systematic guidelines on the rational design of soft materials, but also provoke interdisciplinary discussions on a fundamental question: why does nature select soft materials with unconventional polymer networks to constitute the major parts of animal bodies?",2021-04-12,2021,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c01088,944,4,0.6027808514070735,"['Xuanhe Zhao', 'Xiaoyu Chen', 'Hyunwoo Yuk', 'Shaoting Lin', 'Xinyue Liu', 'German Alberto Parada']",,True
DetectoRS: Detecting Objects with Recursive Feature Pyramid and Switchable Atrous Convolution,"Many modern object detectors demonstrate outstanding performances by using the mechanism of looking and thinking twice. In this paper, we explore this mechanism in the backbone design for object detection. At the macro level, we propose Recursive Feature Pyramid, which incorporates extra feedback connections from Feature Pyramid Networks into the bottom-up backbone layers. At the micro level, we propose Switchable Atrous Convolution, which convolves the features with different atrous rates and gathers the results using switch functions. Combining them results in DetectoRS, which significantly improves the performances of object detection. On COCO test-dev, DetectoRS achieves state-of-the-art 55.7% box AP for object detection, 48.5% mask AP for instance segmentation, and 50.0% PQ for panoptic segmentation.

Therapeutic Anticoagulation with Heparin in Critically Ill Patients with Covid-19,"BACKGROUND: Thrombosis and inflammation may contribute to morbidity and mortality among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). We hypothesized that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation would improve outcomes in critically ill patients with Covid-19. METHODS: In an open-label, adaptive, multiplatform, randomized clinical trial, critically ill patients with severe Covid-19 were randomly assigned to a pragmatically defined regimen of either therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin or pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in accordance with local usual care. The primary outcome was organ support-free days, evaluated on an ordinal scale that combined in-hospital death (assigned a value of -1) and the number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support up to day 21 among patients who survived to hospital discharge. RESULTS: The trial was stopped when the prespecified criterion for futility was met for therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. Data on the primary outcome were available for 1098 patients (534 assigned to therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and 564 assigned to usual-care thromboprophylaxis). The median value for organ support-free days was 1 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) among the patients assigned to therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and was 4 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) among the patients assigned to usual-care thromboprophylaxis (adjusted proportional odds ratio, 0.83; 95% credible interval, 0.67 to 1.03; posterior probability of futility [defined as an odds ratio &lt;1.2], 99.9%). The percentage of patients who survived to hospital discharge was similar in the two groups (62.7% and 64.5%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 95% credible interval, 0.64 to 1.11). Major bleeding occurred in 3.8% of the patients assigned to therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and in 2.3% of those assigned to usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with Covid-19, an initial strategy of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin did not result in a greater probability of survival to hospital discharge or a greater number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support than did usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis.

Leptin and Obesity: Role and Clinical Implication,"The peptide hormone leptin regulates food intake, body mass, and reproductive function and plays a role in fetal growth, proinflammatory immune responses, angiogenesis and lipolysis. Leptin is a product of the obese ( ob ) gene and, following synthesis and secretion from fat cells in white adipose tissue, binds to and activates its cognate receptor, the leptin receptor (LEP-R). LEP-R distribution facilitates leptin’s pleiotropic effects, playing a crucial role in regulating body mass via a negative feedback mechanism between adipose tissue and the hypothalamus. Leptin resistance is characterized by reduced satiety, over-consumption of nutrients, and increased total body mass. Often this leads to obesity, which reduces the effectiveness of using exogenous leptin as a therapeutic agent. Thus, combining leptin therapies with leptin sensitizers may help overcome such resistance and, consequently, obesity. This review examines recent data obtained from human and animal studies related to leptin, its role in obesity, and its usefulness in obesity treatment.",2021-05-18,2021,https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2021.585887,941,1,0.2975568019236037,"['Milan Obradović', 'Emina Sudar-Milovanović', 'Sanja Šoškić', 'Magbubah Essack', 'Swati Arya', 'Alan J.

Modeling Public Mood and Emotion: Twitter Sentiment and Socio-Economic Phenomena,"We perform a sentiment analysis of all tweets published on the microblogging platform Twitter in the second half of 2008. We use a psychometric instrument to extract six mood states (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion) from the aggregated Twitter content and compute a six-dimensional mood vector for each day in the timeline.

Surface‐Preferred Crystal Plane for a Stable and Reversible Zinc Anode,"Abstract Aqueous zinc‐ion batteries are largely restricted by the unsatisfactory performance of zinc (Zn) anodes, including their poor stability and irreversibility. In particular, the mechanism behind the electrochemical contrast caused by the surface crystal plane, which is a decisive factor of the electrochemical characteristics of the hostless Zn anode, is still relatively indistinct. Hence, new insight into a novel anode with a surface‐preferred (002) crystal plane is provided. The interfacial reaction and morphology evolution are revealed by theoretical analysis and post‐mortem/operando experimental techniques, indicating that Zn anodes with more exposed (002) basal planes exhibit free dendrites, no by‐products, and weak hydrogen evolution, in sharp contrast to the (100) plane. These features benefit the Zn (002) anode by enabling a long cyclic life of more than 500 h and a high average coulombic efficiency of 97.71% for symmetric batteries, along with delivering long cycling stability and reversibility with life spans of over 2000 cycles for full batteries. This work provides new insights into the design of high‐performance Zn anodes for large‐scale energy storage and can potentially be applied to other metal anodes suffering from instability and irreversibility.",2021-04-17,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202100187,940,4,0.5258148890516526,"['Miao Zhou', 'Shan Guo', 'Jialin Li', 'Xiongbin Luo', 'Zhexuan Liu', 'Tengsheng Zhang', 'Xinxin Cao', 'Mengqiu Long', 'Bingan Lu', 'Anqiang Pan', 'Guozhao Fang', 'Jiang Zhou', 'Shuquan Liang']",,False

CBTRUS Statistical Report: Primary Brain and Other Central Nervous System Tumors Diagnosed in the United States in 2016—2020,"Abstract The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS), in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute, is the largest population-based registry focused exclusively on primary brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tumors in the United States (US) and represents the entire US population. This report contains the most up-to-date population-based data on primary brain tumors available and supersedes all previous CBTRUS reports in terms of completeness and accuracy. All rates are age-adjusted using the 2000 US standard population and presented per 100,000 population. The average annual age-adjusted incidence rate (AAAIR) of all malignant and non-malignant brain and other CNS tumors was 24.83 per 100,000 population (malignant AAAIR=6.94 and non-malignant AAAIR=17.88). This overall rate was higher in females compared to males (27.85 versus 21.62 per 100,000) and non-Hispanic persons compared to Hispanic persons (25.24 versus 22.61 per 100,000). Gliomas accounted for 26.3% of all tumors. The most commonly occurring malignant brain and other CNS histopathology was glioblastoma (14.2% of all tumors and 50.9% of all malignant tumors), and the most common predominantly non-malignant histopathology was meningioma (40.8% of all tumors and 56.2% of all non-malignant tumors). Glioblastomas were more common in males, and meningiomas were more common in females. In children and adolescents (ages 0-19 years), the incidence rate of all primary brain and other CNS tumors was 6.13 per 100,000 population. There were 86,030 deaths attributed to malignant brain and other CNS tumors between 2016 and 2020. This represents an average annual mortality rate of 4.42 per 100,000 population and an average of 17,206 deaths per year. The five-year relative survival rate following diagnosis of a malignant brain and other CNS tumor was 35.7%, for a non-malignant brain and other CNS tumor the five-year relative survival rate was 91.8%.",2023-10-04,2023,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/noad149,939,-1,0.3950687495032067,"['Quinn T.

Cross-tissue immune cell analysis reveals tissue-specific features in humans,"Despite their crucial role in health and disease, our knowledge of immune cells within human tissues remains limited. We surveyed the immune compartment of 16 tissues from 12 adult donors by single-cell RNA sequencing and VDJ sequencing generating a dataset of ~360,000 cells. To systematically resolve immune cell heterogeneity across tissues, we developed CellTypist, a machine learning tool for rapid and precise cell type annotation. Using this approach, combined with detailed curation, we determined the tissue distribution of finely phenotyped immune cell types, revealing hitherto unappreciated tissue-specific features and clonal architecture of T and B cells.

The Pantheon+ Analysis: Cosmological Constraints,"Abstract We present constraints on cosmological parameters from the Pantheon+ analysis of 1701 light curves of 1550 distinct Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) ranging in redshift from z = 0.001 to 2.26.

The conserved domain database in 2023,"Abstract NLM’s conserved domain database (CDD) is a collection of protein domain and protein family models constructed as multiple sequence alignments. Its main purpose is to provide annotation for protein and translated nucleotide sequences with the location of domain footprints and associated functional sites, and to define protein domain architecture as a basis for assigning gene product names and putative/predicted function. CDD has been available publicly for over 20 years and has grown substantially during that time. Maintaining an archive of pre-computed annotation continues to be a challenge and has slowed down the cadence of CDD releases. CDD curation staff builds hierarchical classifications of large protein domain families, adds models for novel domain families via surveillance of the protein ‘dark matter’ that currently lacks annotation, and now spends considerable effort on providing names and attribution for conserved domain architectures.

Hydrogen Production Technologies: From Fossil Fuels toward Renewable Sources. A Mini Review,"The global economic growth, the increase in the&#13;\npopulation, and advances in technology lead to an increment in the&#13;\nglobal primary energy demand.

This study reviews different technologies for hydrogen&#13;\nproduction using renewable and non-renewable resources.&#13;\nFurthermore, a comparative analysis is performed on renewablebased technologies to evaluate which technologies are economically and energetically more promising. The results show how&#13;\nbiomass-based technologies allow for a similar hydrogen yield compared to those obtained with water-based technologies but with&#13;\nhigher energy efficiencies and lower operational costs. More specifically, biomass gasification and steam reforming obtained a proper&#13;\nbalance between the studied parameters, with gasification being the technique that allows for higher hydrogen yields, while steam&#13;\nreforming is more energy-efficient. Nevertheless, the application of hydrogen as the energy vector of the future requires both the use&#13;\nof renewable feedstocks with a sustainable energy source.

"Global maize production, consumption and trade: trends and R&amp;D implications","Abstract Since its domestication some 9,000 years ago, maize ( Zea mays L.; corn) has played an increasing and diverse role in global agri-food systems. Global maize production has surged in the past few decades, propelled by rising demand and a combination of technological advances, yield increases and area expansion. Maize is already the leading cereal in terms of production volume and is set to become the most widely grown and traded crop in the coming decade. It is a versatile multi-purpose crop, primarily used as a feed globally, but also is important as a food crop, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, besides other non-food uses. This paper reviews maize production, consumption, and international trade to examine the changing trends in global supply and demand conditions over the past quarter century and the implications for research and development (R&amp;D), particularly in the Global South. The inclusiveness and sustainability of the ongoing transformation of agri-food systems in the Global South merit particular attention. There is a need for further investments in R&amp;D, particularly to enhance maize’s food and livelihood security roles and to sustainably intensify maize production while staying within the planetary boundaries.",2022-05-17,2022,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12571-022-01288-7,932,-1,0.2962334204314243,"['Olaf Erenstein', 'Moti Jaleta', 'Kai Sonder', 'Khondoker Abdul Mottaleb', 'B.

"Brain and other central nervous system tumor statistics, 2021","Abstract Brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tumors are among the most fatal cancers and account for substantial morbidity and mortality in the United States. Population‐based data from the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (a combined data set of the National Program of Cancer Registries [NPCR] and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] registries), NPCR, National Vital Statistics System and SEER program were analyzed to assess the contemporary burden of malignant and nonmalignant brain and other CNS tumors (hereafter brain) by histology, anatomic site, age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Malignant brain tumor incidence rates declined by 0.8% annually from 2008 to 2017 for all ages combined but increased 0.5% to 0.7% per year among children and adolescents. Malignant brain tumor incidence is highest in males and non‐Hispanic White individuals, whereas the rates for nonmalignant tumors are highest in females and non‐Hispanic Black individuals. Five‐year relative survival for all malignant brain tumors combined increased between 1975 to 1977 and 2009 to 2015 from 23% to 36%, with larger gains among younger age groups. Less improvement among older age groups largely reflects a higher burden of glioblastoma, for which there have been few major advances in prevention, early detection, and treatment the past 4 decades. Specifically, 5‐year glioblastoma survival only increased from 4% to 7% during the same time period. In addition, important survival disparities by race/ethnicity remain for childhood tumors, with the largest Black‐White disparities for diffuse astrocytomas (75% vs 86% for patients diagnosed during 2009‐2015) and embryonal tumors (59% vs 67%). Increased resources for the collection and reporting of timely consistent data are critical for advancing research to elucidate the causes of sex, age, and racial/ethnic differences in brain tumor occurrence, especially for rarer subtypes and among understudied populations.",2021-08-24,2021,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21693,932,-1,0.33229526800351894,"['Kimberly D.

BindingDB Entry 50022499: ZD1839 (Iressa): an orally active inhibitor of epidermal growth factor signaling with potential for cancer therapy.,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a promising target for anticancer therapy because of its role in tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, and tumor resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We have developed a low-molecular-weight EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), ZD1839 (Iressa(2) ). ZD1839, a substituted anilinoquinazoline, is a potent EGFR-TKI (IC(50) = 0.033 micro M) that selectively inhibits EGF-stimulated tumor cell growth (IC(50) = 0.054 micro M) and that blocks EGF-stimulated EGFR autophosphorylation in tumor cells. In studies with mice bearing a range of human tumor-derived xenografts, ZD1839 given p.o. once a day inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. The level of expression of EGFR did not determine xenograft tumor sensitivity to ZD1839. Long-term ZD1839 (>3 months) treatment of mice bearing A431 xenografts was well tolerated, and ZD1839 completely inhibited tumor growth and induced regression of established tumors. No drug-resistant tumors appeared during ZD1839 treatment, but some tumors regrew after drug withdrawal. These studies indicate the potential utility of ZD1839 in the treatment of many human tumors and indicate that continuous once-a-day p.o. dosing might be a suitable therapeutic regimen.",2025-01-01,2025,https://doi.org/10.7270/q2pc374f,932,3,1.0,"['Alan E.

Artificial gorilla troops optimizer: A new nature‐inspired metaheuristic algorithm for global optimization problems,"Metaheuristics play a critical role in solving optimization problems, and most of them have been inspired by the collective intelligence of natural organisms in nature. This paper proposes a new metaheuristic algorithm inspired by gorilla troops' social intelligence in nature, called Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimizer (GTO). In this algorithm, gorillas' collective life is mathematically formulated, and new mechanisms are designed to perform exploration and exploitation. To evaluate the GTO, we apply it to 52 standard benchmark functions and seven engineering problems. Friedman's test and Wilcoxon rank-sum statistical tests statistically compared the proposed method with several existing metaheuristics. The results demonstrate that the GTO performs better than comparative algorithms on most benchmark functions, particularly on high-dimensional problems. The results demonstrate that the GTO can provide superior results compared with other metaheuristics.",2021-07-12,2021,https://doi.org/10.1002/int.22535,932,0,1.0,"['Benyamın Abdollahzadeh', 'Farhad Soleimanian Gharehchopogh', 'Seyedali Mirjalili']",,True

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces,"Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.",2023-12-01,2023,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2312.00752,931,-1,0.1925176253353416,"['Albert Gu', 'Tri Dao']",,True
Current hydrogel advances in physicochemical and biological response-driven biomedical application diversity,"Abstract Hydrogel is a type of versatile platform with various biomedical applications after rational structure and functional design that leverages on material engineering to modulate its physicochemical properties (e.g., stiffness, pore size, viscoelasticity, microarchitecture, degradability, ligand presentation, stimulus-responsive properties, etc.) and influence cell signaling cascades and fate. In the past few decades, a plethora of pioneering studies have been implemented to explore the cell–hydrogel matrix interactions and figure out the underlying mechanisms, paving the way to the lab-to-clinic translation of hydrogel-based therapies. In this review, we first introduced the physicochemical properties of hydrogels and their fabrication approaches concisely. Subsequently, the comprehensive description and deep discussion were elucidated, wherein the influences of different hydrogels properties on cell behaviors and cellular signaling events were highlighted. These behaviors or events included integrin clustering, focal adhesion (FA) complex accumulation and activation, cytoskeleton rearrangement, protein cyto-nuclei shuttling and activation (e.g., Yes-associated protein (YAP), catenin, etc.), cellular compartment reorganization, gene expression, and further cell biology modulation (e.g., spreading, migration, proliferation, lineage commitment, etc.). Based on them, current in vitro and in vivo hydrogel applications that mainly covered diseases models, various cell delivery protocols for tissue regeneration and disease therapy, smart drug carrier, bioimaging, biosensor, and conductive wearable/implantable biodevices, etc. were further summarized and discussed. More significantly, the clinical translation potential and trials of hydrogels were presented, accompanied with which the remaining challenges and future perspectives in this field were emphasized. Collectively, the comprehensive and deep insights in this review will shed light on the design principles of new biomedical hydrogels to understand and modulate cellular processes, which are available for providing significant indications for future hydrogel design and serving for a broad range of biomedical applications.",2021-12-16,2021,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00830-x,930,-1,0.29167658955114734,"['Huấn Cao', 'Lixia Duan', 'Yan Zhang', 'Jun Cao', 'Kun Zhang']",,True
"The MTT Assay: Utility, Limitations, Pitfalls, and Interpretation in Bulk and Single-Cell Analysis","The MTT assay for cellular metabolic activity is almost ubiquitous to studies of cell toxicity; however, it is commonly applied and interpreted erroneously. We investigated the applicability and limitations of the MTT assay in representing treatment toxicity, cell viability, and metabolic activity. We evaluated the effect of potential confounding variables on the MTT assay measurements on a prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) including cell seeding number, MTT concentration, MTT incubation time, serum starvation, cell culture media composition, released intracellular contents (cell lysate and secretome), and extrusion of formazan to the extracellular space. We also assessed the confounding effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) as a tested treatment in PC-3 cells on the assay measurements. We additionally evaluated the applicability of microscopic image cytometry as a tool for measuring intracellular MTT reduction at the single-cell level. Our findings show that the assay measurements are a result of a complicated process dependant on many of the above-mentioned factors, and therefore, optimization of the assay and rational interpretation of the data is necessary to prevent misleading conclusions on variables such as cell viability, treatment toxicity, and/or cell metabolism. We conclude, with recommendations on how to apply the assay and a perspective on where the utility of the assay is a powerful tool, but likewise where it has limitations.",2021-11-26,2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms222312827,930,-1,0.03331911750998498,"['Mahshid Ghasemi', 'Tyron Turnbull', 'Sonia Sebastian', 'Ivan M.

Characterising long COVID: a living systematic review,"Background While it is now apparent clinical sequelae (long COVID) may persist after acute COVID-19, their nature, frequency and aetiology are poorly characterised. This study aims to regularly synthesise evidence on long COVID characteristics, to help inform clinical management, rehabilitation strategies and interventional studies to improve long-term outcomes. Methods A living systematic review. Medline, CINAHL (EBSCO), Global Health (Ovid), WHO Global Research on COVID-19 database, LitCovid and Google Scholar were searched till 17 March 2021. Studies including at least 100 people with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19 at 12 weeks or more post onset were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the tool produced by Hoy et al . Results were analysed using descriptive statistics and meta-analyses to estimate prevalence. Results A total of 39 studies were included: 32 cohort, 6 cross-sectional and 1 case–control. Most showed high or moderate risk of bias. None were set in low-income countries and few included children. Studies reported on 10 951 people (48% female) in 12 countries. Most included previously hospitalised people (78%, 8520/10 951). The longest mean follow-up time was 221.7 (SD: 10.9) days post COVID-19 onset. Over 60 physical and psychological signs and symptoms with wide prevalence were reported, most commonly weakness (41%; 95% CI 25% to 59%), general malaise (33%; 95% CI 15% to 57%), fatigue (31%; 95% CI 24% to 39%), concentration impairment (26%; 95% CI 21% to 32%) and breathlessness (25%; 95% CI 18% to 34%). 37% (95% CI 18% to 60%) of patients reported reduced quality of life; 26% (10/39) of studies presented evidence of reduced pulmonary function. Conclusion Long COVID is a complex condition with prolonged heterogeneous symptoms. The nature of studies precludes a precise case definition or risk evaluation. There is an urgent need for prospective, robust, standardised, controlled studies into aetiology, risk factors and biomarkers to characterise long COVID in different at-risk populations and settings.

Implications of Adnexal Invasions in Primary Extramammary Paget’s Disease: A Systematic Review,"Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD) is an erratic malignant skin disorder primarily affecting skin areas abundant with skin appendages like hair follicles. The vulva is most involved site, followed by genital areas, penoscrotal regions and axillary skin. EMPD presents as erythematous skin lesions resembling eczema, typically progressing slowly, either primary or secondary manifestations. Primary EMPD originates as an intraepithelial neoplasm of the epidermis, often leading to local lymph node metastases and distant metastases. A systematic literature search using targeted keywords across multiple databases was conducted. Studies focusing on EMPD, adnexal involvement, depth, recurrence, and prognosis were included by keeping in view the objective which is to determine the significance of adnexal involvement and depth concerning recurrence and prognosis in the primary EMPD. Adnexal involvement, especially in hair follicles and eccrine ducts, is prevalent in primary EMPD. However, its correlation with tumor progression or recurrence rates remains inconclusive. Surgical excision, including Mohs micrographic surgery, is the primary therapeutic approach, with topical agents and systemic treatments used in advanced cases.

A Survey of Deep Active Learning,"Active learning (AL) attempts to maximize a model’s performance gain while annotating the fewest samples possible. Deep learning (DL) is greedy for data and requires a large amount of data supply to optimize a massive number of parameters if the model is to learn how to extract high-quality features. In recent years, due to the rapid development of internet technology, we have entered an era of information abundance characterized by massive amounts of available data. As a result, DL has attracted significant attention from researchers and has been rapidly developed. Compared with DL, however, researchers have a relatively low interest in AL. This is mainly because before the rise of DL, traditional machine learning requires relatively few labeled samples, meaning that early AL is rarely according the value it deserves. Although DL has made breakthroughs in various fields, most of this success is due to a large number of publicly available annotated datasets. However, the acquisition of a large number of high-quality annotated datasets consumes a lot of manpower, making it unfeasible in fields that require high levels of expertise (such as speech recognition, information extraction, medical images, etc.). Therefore, AL is gradually coming to receive the attention it is due. It is therefore natural to investigate whether AL can be used to reduce the cost of sample annotation while retaining the powerful learning capabilities of DL. As a result of such investigations, deep active learning (DeepAL) has emerged. Although research on this topic is quite abundant, there has not yet been a comprehensive survey of DeepAL-related works; accordingly, this article aims to fill this gap. We provide a formal classification method for the existing work, along with a comprehensive and systematic overview. In addition, we also analyze and summarize the development of DeepAL from an application perspective. Finally, we discuss the confusion and problems associated with DeepAL and provide some possible development directions.",2021-10-08,2021,https://doi.org/10.1145/3472291,929,0,0.38287872307573656,"['Pengzhen Ren', 'Yun Xiao', 'Xiaojun Chang', 'Po-Yao Huang', 'Zhihui Li', 'Brij B.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Heat Transfer Problems,"Abstract Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained popularity across different engineering fields due to their effectiveness in solving realistic problems with noisy data and often partially missing physics. In PINNs, automatic differentiation is leveraged to evaluate differential operators without discretization errors, and a multitask learning problem is defined in order to simultaneously fit observed data while respecting the underlying governing laws of physics. Here, we present applications of PINNs to various prototype heat transfer problems, targeting in particular realistic conditions not readily tackled with traditional computational methods. To this end, we first consider forced and mixed convection with unknown thermal boundary conditions on the heated surfaces and aim to obtain the temperature and velocity fields everywhere in the domain, including the boundaries, given some sparse temperature measurements. We also consider the prototype Stefan problem for two-phase flow, aiming to infer the moving interface, the velocity and temperature fields everywhere as well as the different conductivities of a solid and a liquid phase, given a few temperature measurements inside the domain. Finally, we present some realistic industrial applications related to power electronics to highlight the practicality of PINNs as well as the effective use of neural networks in solving general heat transfer problems of industrial complexity. Taken together, the results presented herein demonstrate that PINNs not only can solve ill-posed problems, which are beyond the reach of traditional computational methods, but they can also bridge the gap between computational and experimental heat transfer.",2021-03-17,2021,https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4050542,928,0,0.3236661760871612,"['Shengze Cai', 'Zhicheng Wang', 'Sifan Wang', 'Paris Perdikaris', 'George Em Karniadakis']",,False
Domain Generalization: A Survey,"Generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data is a capability natural to humans yet challenging for machines to reproduce. This is because most learning algorithms strongly rely on the i.i.d. assumption on source/target data, which is often violated in practice due to domain shift.

Over the last ten years, research in DG has made great progress, leading to a broad spectrum of methodologies, e.g., those based on domain alignment, meta-learning, data augmentation, or ensemble learning, to name a few; DG has also been studied in various application areas including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, medical imaging, and reinforcement learning. In this paper, for the first time a comprehensive literature review in DG is provided to summarize the developments over the past decade.
